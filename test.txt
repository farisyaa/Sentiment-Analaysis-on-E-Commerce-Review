__label__2 Great Series opener: I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all.
__label__2 cj: It has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni. Good addition for a quick nutritional meal. It does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste.
__label__2 INTERESTING AND SAD! , BUT VERY WELL DONE!: This is very interesting film that is really five stories in one. A dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another. A great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time. The film is ultimately sad and depressing, but each story is very interesting. With a cast featuring Toni Collette, Giovanni Ribisi, Piper Laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong?
__label__1 Missing most of the play!: This version of the play is MISSING Acts III and IV.Act IV, Scene ii contains some of the most famous lines of Shakespeare: "Fear no more the heat of the sun ..." So, if you need this play, are crunched for time, and need it to supplement a research paper on stream-of-consciousness and Mrs. Dalloway ... I would definitely GET ANOTHER VERSION!Thanks a lot for the complete rip off.
__label__2 Mixing historical with fictional fill-in interesting: Book of John is my favorite of the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ's ministry on earth. I like the mix of what is historically known about the apostle John with the fictional story to fill in and make an interesting read. Then The Gospel of John and the 3 Epistles written by John are also included at the end of the book.Have also read the other "Jesus Chronicles" by same authors about Matthew, Mark, and Luke. I recommend all of them.Love being able to download books to the Kindle App on my Toshiba Thrive Tablet.
__label__1 This Blu ray will NOT work on Australian (region B) players: Hello everyone,Just to bring it to the attention of all region B player owners.The version of this movie that Amazon is selling will not play on region B Blu-ray players.I did do my research on www.bluray.com. There is information there that says it is region free but this information is wrong (at least for this version of the movie anyway).I like this movie by the way, it was my first purchase on DVD.I hope this saves some people from making the same mistake I did.Amazon are not to blame, they resolved my issue in less then 1 day. I love shopping for Blu-rays here and this will not discourage me from any future purchases. Just make sure you do your research before you buy.All the best.
__label__2 For God and Country: The production values of this film are excellant and the script is first rate. The overall performance of the entire cast is also excellant. However, the viewer knows what is going to happan in this movie as soon as it starts. The good guys(the English) are going to win. The entire film is a trip to this end- the only mysteries being who of the not most major actors in this film are "killed" in the battles to come and how the British captain defeats a bigger, faster, and better armed French ship. This is not to make lite of this film, it is entertaining and interesting. Just how many times you will rewatch this film- the purchaser will have to decide.
__label__1 torture!!: This book is painful to read because you are hosted by a crotchety old man who is annoyed by life and loves no one except his dog. He meets people who he finds boring and visits places that insult him and tells you about all of the lousy things that happen to him and then reminds you of all of the good things that have disappeared about America. If you love Steinbeck don't read this book because perhaps you are meeting the real man and you will feel different about his other beautiful books. If you don't know Steinbeck and want to, try Pastures of Heaven or Cannery Row. Those books are how you want to remember him by, and not by this last, wheezing gasp.
__label__1 Pricy: Of course as all things computer related, as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically. Unit works great but buy the 2 gig. More bang for the $$
__label__1 TERRIBLE, UNWATCHABLE GORE FEST: I also was unaware of the fact that there were 2 "versions" of the movie. I have to ditto other reviews. Horrified, my husband and I fast forwarded assuming this was some sort of dream sequence gone bad and the investigation would start up soon. Wrong. Just avoid this movie it is really awful.
__label__1 one of Mandys worst movies: This movie was one of Mandy Moores earliest movies. Her acting was good, she looked real good, and she gets turned down, get real directors, not likely to happen in real life. Franka Potente looks too old and too hard for this movie. The story is weak and unrealistic, Elija is ok, but plays the part of a stupid dude. Don't waste your money, unless you just want to see how a bad script is made into a bad movie.
__label__1 Lemon: I ordered my Toshiba SD 1200 in August of 2000. It was broken out of the box. After 6 weeks of waiting, I got it back and it never quite worked properly after that. Nothing you could take it back for -- it was quirky and unreliable, deciding on one day that it could not handle layer changes, on others that it would not read a disk that it read fine the previous day. Well, last night when I ejected a disk, it literally flew out of the tray, still spinning. Now the unit won't do a thing except sit there. The warranty has expired, of course. I will never buy a Toshiba product again. If nothing else, they have quality control issues.
__label__1 grade A bullflop: The Only reason I gave this movie 1 star is because there is no option to give it none. I beg you, don't waste your time on this sad excuse for a movie. Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, and horrible story. The idea of the multiverse is a good one, but this movie did not come up with that concept, and every aspect of this movie is a mockery of it. To me, this movie had no redeeming qualities, and it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
__label__2 Very well written: One of the best as far as romance novels. Very well written with a very moving plot. Basically, the hero and heroine meet briefly before the hero suffers what seems to be a hemorrhagic stroke and loses his ability to speak and form words. The heroine is the only one to help him, even when everyone else has given him up to the insane asylum.
__label__1 the prince and me turns out to be a royal pain.: Far from anything new, The Prince and Me once again tells women, "You can have your cake, and eat it too." It's a tale of a college student Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) seeking anything but another guy to distract her from her studies. In the mean time Prince Edwards (Luke Mably) finds himself in Wisconsin seeking women. He just so happens to meet Paige at a bar and everything bad breaks lose. They soon fall in love and Eddie is forced to become king of Denmark, and must soon find a queen. This movie has a perfect fairytale ending, and was a complete bore. After being two full hours, the movie could have been cut to an hour instead.
__label__2 Does what it's designed to do.: Hole punches like this are for punching PAPER. It punched through 4 layers of card stock quite easily. If you're looking for something to punch through leather, cardboard etc. you need to pay more and get a heavier punch.
__label__2 Fantastic and one of my favorites: Fantastic film. The central four characters work best as an ensemble, which Ritchie realized, so the Gang of Four (as I like to call them) are pretty much together throughout the film when they are featured. Much of the acting is ensemble. There are individual performances that stand out to me, though, such as Jason Statham's rowdily uproarious portrayal of Bacon, Dexter Fletcher's finicky, knife-obsessed Soap, Vinnie Jones's brutal, yet extremely whimsical Big Chris, and Sting's cold and calculated JD. In particular, I love Vas Blackwood's hilariously nasty performance as "that madman with an Afro", Rory Breaker, as well as Frank Harper's ultimately terrifying and likely psychotic Dog, Steve Sweeney's vocally-sprained, to-the-hilt Cockneyisms as Plank, and an emaciated Steven Mackintosh's acidic, yet finally naive Winston. The plot's too much to explain here, but just see it and you'll get it. Great, great movie.
__label__1 Now this is a bad trip! - Grotesque, not funny: I bought this after reading the reviews here. To make a long story short, it's the only DVD I 'm considering throwing on the trash can. I have more than 90, from all genres, and never felt this idiot before. The film is ridiculous, the acting is grotesque, I can't believe it gives pleasure to anyone. It's worst than many summer comedies, because it tries to be "cult". Everything is so overacted and predictable that I didn't even smile once while watching it. As for the DVD only, it's normal, no valuable extras (if only this was possible with such a movie). The Amazon ranking was one of my guides for movies. After this bad trip I'll consider more before buying.
__label__1 Magritte video - not suitable for school viewing: I ordered this DVD to supplement my surrealism project I teach to my art students. Good thing I watched it first! Magritte has SO many cool works of art....and yet the focus in this movie seems to be on his nude paintings. Several times the camera even zooms in for a closeup of the breasts!! I'm not a prude by any means, but come on. A couple of times they even showed a live nude woman....and I have no idea why they needed to do that. Shock value?Anyway, it's a useless video for my classroom. THe only views of the majority of his works are in passing in several art museum shots from far away. Crazy.Would not advise this for a classroom viewing.
__label__1 not happening dude: I have to say after becoming accustomed by djs and producersthat actually have talent, this cd is old trendy [stuff]. I have tried listening to this cd numerous times after seeing tons of good [comments] but it still just doesn't do it. Go pick up some quality mixes like Frankie Bones' "You know my name" or even check out Danny Tenaglia's GU Athens- don't waste your cash
__label__2 Awesome album!: I am a more casual Kate Bush fan, but I really love most of the songs on this album. My favorites are "Running Up That Hill," "The Big Sky," "Mother Stands For Comfort," and "Under Ice." My least favorite on the album is "Waking The Witch"-- I think it's just a little too out there for me. Maybe it will grow on me."The Morning Fog" has a very upbeat quality that none of the other songs really have and "Hello Earth" has some great vocal layering going on.Overall, I find this album outstanding. Perhaps with more listens I will love it even more!
__label__2 Book was damaged: We absolutely loved the book. But there was a fairly large dent in the cover that I didn't realize was going to be there.
__label__2 The All-American Rejects Rock!!!: This is a great album because the lyrics and music are very good and Tyson Ritter is hot. And I just love the all the songs which is surprising because most cds I buy I only like a few songs. And on this cd I can't even think of a favorite song on the album except for maybe these 3 songs "My Paper Heart", "Swing Swing" and "One More Sad Song". I think everyone should go out right now and but this cd because trust me you won't regret it at all.
__label__1 Flat allegory: I've meant to read this for years. (Love Tolkien, Asimov's Foundation, and Harry Potter.)It is a painfully slow, grim story of two-dimensional characters and nature descriptions that reads more like the account of a self-flagellant religious than a story of discovery and adventure.Tolkein was right to distrust allegory in all of its forms.Rob Inglis got me through a book I would never have finished in print, but he also may have been the wrong reader for this story. Perhaps it would have been more persuasive read by a woman or a more juvenile voice.
__label__2 simply the best!: excellent tool and quality, buy it without hesitation if you need to dig, simply for any garden work. Not for females unless they are physically strong, No cons at all. Love to work with this shove, I am really enjoying it!
__label__2 On Time: I received my book on time as I was promised. I would purchase from this source again with no hesitation.
__label__2 Best history of the Church of England: This is the best book I have found on the history of the English Reformation and of the Church of England through the middle of the 20th C. I have read it twice and still refer to it often. It's definitely worth owning if you have any interest in this area.
__label__1 She does not like the taste. I don't like the smell: These may work. They may help my dog with pain. Too bad they smell so horrible that my dog won't eat them.The smell of chemicals is overpowering when you open the bottle. Good luck getting your dog to take these. You are better off with buffered aspirin shoved in a treat than wasting your money on this product.
__label__1 Slow, tireing and no ending: I loved Le Carre's early works and the he went down hill and this one hit bottom. I finished this book looking for at least ten more pages. I thought the printer left them out.
__label__2 Good Stuff: Hammer products are all good except the Solids. The solids are to dry, which Hammer mentions. The gel tastes good and works. I pour it into a flask and use it on my long bike rides.I haven't felt any spikes from it and it doesn't seem to amp me up.
__label__1 Choose a different Pug book!: If you were only to buy one pug book, this isn't it. I am a new pug owner and needed a resource that was specific to my new friend. This book had only about 20 pages that had to do with pugs, the rest was generic, not much help. So let's say it doesn't bother you that you won't find a thing out about pugs, well another big reason to avoid this book at all costs is it looks like a 1974 printing. How much of the information is out dated?
__label__2 Between Thieves' Self-Titled CD.: Songs include: 01. Despite the Rain 4:04.35; 02 Seen in Me 3:54.10; 03 Kindle 4:05.60; 04 Two Pennies 3:47.10; 05 Now 4:13.45; 06 To the End 4:23.62; 07 Slings and Arrows 3:49.40; 08 Take My Hand 5:41.73; 09 Lay It Down 4:45.02 10 No More 3:52.53; 11 Privately 7:10.02. Between Thieves, (formerly Judah), are no longer playing together as Between Thieves. Josh Watkins plays guitar with Glisten, and Jesse Reeves now plays bass for Chris Tomlin.
__label__1 Ick!: This game was not very good. The songs are basically the same as the first one and game play is very hard.
__label__2 Norah Jones is Amazing: This CD is by far the best I have heard this year. What an amazing voice! This has opened my eyes to a whole new music genre.
__label__2 poolhall junkies: My son (age 18)asked for this movie for Christmas. It was a good movie with morales and the teenagers like it; I liked it as well.
__label__1 kitchen aid food grinder: I have had a grinder for over 40 years when I bought my first Kitchen aid mixer. It lasted and lasted.My cutting blade finally could not cut the meat so I ordered a new one this past March 2012. When Ireceived it, I was excited to grind some meat and WOW I was SO disappointed with the cutting blade!! It is apiece of junk!!!! Barely cuts the meat to send it through as ground meat. I don't recommend it. Kitchenaidis becoming quality junk!! It used to be a solid name with dependability. Since Whirlpool took it over manyyears ago, it has gone through a metamorphosis that is downgraded.
__label__1 A Miss........: While I thought PASSION was marvelous - I cannot say the same for PATIENCE - I read it to the bitter end, all the while feeling very uncomfortable. All that Dom/Sub seemed to come out of left field, almost as if there was a chapter or three missing. Valdez writes really well - but this one to me seemed like a car accident, how in the world did Matthew know Patience was a sub - where in the world was the story behind how he became a Dom - oh yeah a page or so about when he was 12. What about Matthew's former fiancée? Engaged for how long and he never? Notwithstanding that she alluded to ....something .......one huge hit with PASSION, and a very long time for a reader to wait for one very clear miss with PATIENCE
__label__1 Never received ordered item: I never received the ordered item, but a charger instead. They failed to respond to my email.
__label__1 I think that this book is so badly: I think that this book is so badly,I thought that I have been deceived, first, this book not necessarily is that book which I need, although the book title page is the book title page which and I order is the same, but the content actually downloads with me electronic version each entry difference are too many. Second, the book print quality is very bad, the printing shop uses paper thin elephant toilet tissue, what is most hateful is above also has spreads the picture, but also has the book side also to have the trace which the man-power draws. All these cause me to the shopping to have the very big suspicion once more in the expensive website, I felt that I have been deceived, but there is no place suit, I will spend 300 the nearly Renminbi to obtain indeed will also be pirate the book
__label__1 Just nostalgia should not make a movie great: I like western, but this movie is waaaaaaaaaayy weak. Bad acting from multiple characters, absurd victory of the "good-guys" corny expressions--too many slapstick moments.I think the story is the problem and so is the direction. The landscape and soundtrack is gorgeous. If you can tolerate bad parts and weak acting--go for it. Otherwise, pass.
__label__2 Best Daddy gift ever!: This is an amazing book and makes every dad melt when his daughter shares her thoughts and he shares his. My father started the same book with me over ten years ago by giving it to me on Christmas with a few entries in his section. Then I gave it back to him on Father's Day with some of my entries. This was to be our tradition until the book was filled.I now have the privilege of giving this book to my daughter's dad so they can start their tradition (she is still little but why wait).Some dads have a hard time sharing their memories but this allows them to catalog the random things their daughter's will cherish later in life. And they get to know what was special to their daughter.Buy it for your dad, your husband, your brother - any dad you know!!
__label__1 Get a life: Boring book, he doesn't know how to get to point. It takes him two chapters to get someone up a hill.
__label__2 My feet wouldn't stop moving; and they still don't!!!!: Vachon's guitar is blistering; the horns are pure and crisp (as usual), the rest are flawless, and Sugar Ray knockes 'em dead with his superb voice!! Look for them live...worth whatever the price is!
__label__2 Slow start, ... but there's interest and surprise ahead...: Like I said, the book gets off to a slow start, but get about100 pages in and you have met all the major characters and it is justone twist after another. My reason for giving only 4 stars was because of the ending... not quite what I expected, but interesting nonetheless.
__label__2 Great Memoir: I throughly enjoyed reading this book. The author does a great job of showing us, in vivid detail, the realities of combat. Reading this book will give you a new appreciation for what our fighting men go through.
__label__2 THANKS: THANKS FOR THIS MOVIE!I LOVE THIS MOVIE.LOVE DRAKE AND JOSH <3Thanks again. Love this so so much
__label__2 Dremel 575 Right Angle Attachment for Rotary Tool: I had been looking for something like this for awhile and so I was quite happy to have come across this attachment. It has proven itself to be very useful and I am quite satisfied with it. It has perfomed without any problems so far and is quite easy to use. I would recommend this tool to everyone.
__label__1 Total Crap: This horrible mangling of a talented artist is total crap. This cd is almost a big an insult to real musicians as that Hung.
__label__2 Coop Rocks!: Take it from someone who's been listening since she was 7 years old, nobody beats Coop! Even if you're just mildly curious about him and are just familiar with a few of his songs, this really is a must see. There's a good chance you will get hooked!Love him, yes we love him!
__label__2 Good...: I think this was good... that is mostly all I can say because I really enjoyed the wheel of time series and if I had not been caught up in the story from all the book that proceeded this one I would not have enjoyed this as much... still, it is very interesting conclusion to the wheel of time (for now) and the last few chapters were worth crawling through the rest of it.
__label__2 I was very pleased with the Crest Smooth ...: I was very pleased with the Crest Smooth Mint Gel. The squeeze bottle is very easy to use and the mint flavor isn't overpowering. I think the squeeze tube sets this product above other brands of toothpaste because there's no mess involved when using it. You never have to roll up the end of the tube to get the last of the toothpaste out. I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends. It definitely lives up to the standards that I've come to expect from Crest.
__label__1 Don't buy this book: Not worth your money. And if you have this book, you might as well donate it to some bum so he can burn it for heat
__label__2 Good plot, sad ending...: I have to admit that I only went on reading this book because of the character Troy. He was different but why does Ms. Andrews had to make his character so... feminine? I realized a lot of you people out there fell in love with Troy, but he was so GIRLISH in some ways. Funny... The love between Troy and Heaven was so sad. They couldn't be together at the end, because, well, it was forbidden. I don't want to burst this story to anyone who haven't read this book yet. I noticed that V.C. has a thing with "incest", which totally screws up her books for that is *DISGUSTING.* Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and it was unfair of what happened to Troy at the end, even though he couldn't be with Heaven. I'm just wondering... why does almost everyone dye their hair blond these days? Can't you go with your natural hair color? You'd know what I mean when you read this book. Toodles! :D
__label__1 get tupac instead: yo on the real, x's new album is beter than the one before, but both were wack. the first one was tight, but then he fell off. i would recommend all of u to get the new 2pac cd. its one of the best to drop in 99....peace out.
__label__1 Book - not thrilled with quality.: Disappointed when I received the book. Immediately threw the cover away due to water damage or mold (could not detect). Wondering to keep the book not knowing the damage to it - did not occur in transit.
__label__2 Some Good Stories, Some Superb Stories: Peter Beagle has given us six stories set in the world of his novel The Innkeeper's Song. It's the same world, but not the same location, and, except for one story, not the same characters. Other reviewers have pointed out that the fact that there is a different teller for each story helps maintain interest from story to story, and I agree. I also agree (mostly) with the reviewer who states that the last three stories in the book are better than the first three. I found "Choushi-Wai's Story" to be as good a story as I've ever read, comparable in quality to P.G. Wodehouse's "Lord Emsworth and the Girl-Friend", Yasunari Kawabata's "The Dancing Girl of Izu", or the best of Hemingway's stories. "Giant Bones", the title story, isn't far behind.Beagle is that rare author who has given us both great novels and great stories, and readers have been blessed that he has done that for close to fifty years now.
__label__1 Not Even Good for Coasters!: Worst ever. Of the first five discs off the spindle, three were bad --- and this is at low (8x) speed with a SONY drive!AVOID these, period. 1-star rating is only because I couldn't give 'em zero stars. Try Memorex -- never had any trouble with them.
__label__2 warm and cozy: My little guy will only sleep in Halo SleepSacks. We've tried several other brands that are more readily available in stores, but with no luck. This one has been perfect for our colder weather with just a little pj outfit underneath. It keeps his nice and cozy - which has been helping him to sleep better. The material is soft and washes well.
__label__2 Overall, a very good book about incense: This book gives very good advice about making incense at home. I like the fact that the author discourages the use of salt petre and blank cones and sticks for oil dipping. There is a troubleshoot guide in the question/answer format that is helpful. Without a doubt, the author has a passion for making incense.There is a part in the book that lists suppliers. It is a little confusing because it says Internet sources, but it lists the mailing addresses and phone numbers without the Internet addresses.Overall, the book is a good starting point, but leaves out information that would classify it as a "comprehensive guide" to making incense. The author encourages experimentation rather than completely engaging in instruction. I guess I am trying to say it could have gone further into some topics, but I am glad I bought the book and recommend it to anyone interested in learning to make their own incense.
__label__1 Timer doesn't work!: I just opened the box, followed the instructions to put everything together, started testing it out, then I found out the timer was broken! It is stuck at the zero position and there is no way to turn it. It was a complete waste of money, and the most ironic thing is that the toy is called "Perfection" and it is anything but perfect.
__label__2 Another chapter in African history: Not having read the book on which "Something of Value" was based, I don't know how faithful the film is to the book. However, it is an evocative and provocative film. A younger Hudson portrays a white South African whose best friend is a black South African (Sidney Poitier). Having grown up together, the boys become young men subjected to the racial pressures of the MauMau era.Hudson's character remains sympathetic throughout, and viewers will also be able to understand the coercion placed on Poitier's character because of apartheid.Hudson doesn't get much of an opportunity to prove his acting ability, nor is Poitier's character given wide range. If one has not read the book, the conclusion of the film is not telegraphed -- those following the story for the first time will not know whether the ending will be tragic or inspiring, or whether either of the two men will survive.All in all, it is a worthwhile movie.
__label__1 I don't know if I can keep going: It has taken me two months to read this book, it never takes me that long to read 1 freaking book. I had to force myself to read it and I was trying to finish this series by the end of the year, doesn't look like it's going to happen..The authors should be ashamed of themselves for milking people by dragging this story out. I hope they don't think they can take all the money with them. And I refused to pay full price of any of the books, so I'm not contributing to their wealth. Thank God for library book sales.
__label__2 The kitty and bird movie: I remembered watching this and it was a cute cartoon. Just wish they added more episodes to it.
__label__1 The worst I ever seen: I wasted almost 30 argentine pesos in a movie that is one of the worst I've ever seen. To see Lesley Ann Warren wasted in a movie like this makes me want to cry my heart out.Only the soundtrack is good, and please tell George Strait to stop acting, he sings very well, but his acting is not good at all.
__label__2 Steven Spielberg Produced: Educational and fun for both children and adults. Most everything Mr. Spielberg is connected to is 5 star.
__label__1 yuck: While this book was well-written and easy to get involved in, it left me feeling vaguely nauseous. The entire thing was disturbing, and then it gets this neatly-tied-up happy ending. Ick. NOT a book I would recommend to anyone.
__label__1 A weak book: It's mostly a self-serving rant about all kinds of things Hughes doesn't like, and it has hardly a thoughtful or well-researched idea behind it. I don't think this kind of book does anyone any good--it simply encourages people to be intellectually lazy and to whine about what personally affronts their private sensibilities. A narcissitic book from a very vain, very pompous man.
__label__2 energy: This CD isn't only technique - it's merry, a frolicing good time. Props to "Field Day", a song from the POV of cops busting an anti-war march in LA, turning it into a riot. "And if you're pregnant, I'll kick you. Because a pregnant one counts as two."
__label__2 I Am Grateful: This cd has something for everyone... great worship, upbeat songs, and something to ride to all while keepin your mind on Jesus. Good job
__label__2 The Best Resource for Tradition as well as Recipes!: A friend and I have recently begun taking tea and we love the true British and Victorian style of tea houses. I wanted to find a book for her that was a great resource on the history of afternoon and high tea as well as providing some recipes to go along with the information. This was the best book I found. No other goes into as much detail about the history of tea that this book does. The only downfall is that the only illustrations in the book are line drawings. There are no photos. Still, that didn't keep me from picking this book over several others that did have nice pictures, because in the end, the content of this book superceded any other.
__label__1 Head in the Sand: What could have been a fascinating tale about a boy who just couldn't say no is told in a trite high-school note manner whispered over the shoulder in Health Class. The author lacks writing ability but makes up for it in gossip, kiss-n-tell and anecdotes worthy of the Starr Report. It's a shame Cal Culver didn't sleep with Arthur Miller. We'd have gotten a tale worth reading two-handed.
__label__1 Read Marjorie Garber instead: Has the thinking in any book ever been more thoroughly demolished than this one has been by Marjorie Garber in her "Use and Abuse of Literature"? Read hers instead of this.
__label__1 bungee stap: the picture showed a few straps. Did not fremember requesting a color, so thought the price was for all of them. Would not buy a single one for that price along with \shipping charges.
__label__1 No go: After I purchased my first MP3 Player and watched it die within a week, I decided to purchase this player. I did not turn on. No go. DOA. After consulting the manual, I decided to call customer service. After waiting 15 minutes on the phone, I decided to pack it up and return it to Walmart. Very disappointing. If you read some of the other reviews, they are right about one thing--customer service is almost nonexistent.
__label__2 Wow! What a surprise: I thought this movie looked interesting, but I wasn't expecting too much. Boy, was I in for a surprise. What a terrific movie, in a disturbing kind of way. I tend to like Costner movies, although I've always thought of his acting as a bit 2 dimensional. Not in this case. Mr. Costner outdoes himself here, and the rest of the cast is right there too. Mr. Hurt is spectacular as well. And unlike some, I thought the cop was a well done character, too. Who in life does not have their off work life spill over into the job to distract them once in a while. I wasn't expecting more than a somewhat entertaining movie, and what I got is a movie that is near the top of my list of all time favorites. Five Stars PLUS!
__label__2 Mandela (1987): Mandela(1987) as portrayed by Danny Glover is one of those classic movies/documentaries one would wantto keep in his library. It's been many years since i saw this film, and i must admit that despite mytender age of 13 when my family was owning this film, its memory is still intact.It's unfortunate that the film is not available in DVD today. But, even in VHS quality and availability, someantiques, the notable of this film never surrenders to the new ones.Danny Glover was extremely outstanding in his portrayal of Nelson Mandela's struggles for South Africa-tusslingwith the security apparatus of the Apartheid regime(the apparent machinery of the government), haggling in courts for his peoples' rights to vote, his seduction and woo of Winnie Madikizela, and his versatile disposition[s] in dealing with the day to day challengesof a 'segregated society' before he was sent to languish in jail.
__label__2 Answer to previous review above from Pete M. Demola: I will be purchasing this album tomorrow, 1/26/2005. Listening to a number of preview tracks it is a must buy for me. I have enjoyed their collaborations with Tim Burgess from the Charlatans, probably one of my all time favorite bands.It sounds to me that a Strokes song is sampled on "Surface To Air", but I could be wrong. The title of the song escapes me however.More to come...Rob Mac
__label__1 I hate this toothbrush: I got this toothbrush because my dentist, who is also a friend, recommended it to me. My sonicare was about 5 years old and was starting to have trouble holding a charge, so I was in the market for something new. This toothbrush, rather than automatically recharging while in a base, has to be plugged in and is already (3 months old) starting to not hold a charge. We have to fully recharge it about every 7 days. You cannot use it while it is plugged in.A bigger issue for me, also something that was not a problem with the Sonicare, is that when the toothpaste foams and drips on the handle slides down and gets between the brush head and the handle. So now there is gunk all over the place that you are supposed to put the brush head and inside the brush head. It's a mess. And it was expensive!
__label__1 Superbad: The Music track on the concert is the worst I have ever heard. The DVD does have 4 videos that are great. Not worth the money or the time to watch it. I am surprised the artist let this be released?
__label__2 Blue Hawaiians hit their stride: This may be their best CD (possible exception is the Christmas CD). The playing is inspired, the arrangements are pure 60s surfdom. Great fidelity to boot. The bonus track should only be listened to STRAIGHT (or you risk years of therapy).
__label__1 Bad Business: This seller has failed to contact me and my stuff has not been received 2 weeks after it was supposed to be here. Do Not Buy From Them
__label__2 An absolute must for serious Internet information.: A fabulous book. The clear, sharp style has dragged me through a lot of technical stuff that I would have otherwise been ignorant of. You have armed me to the teeth and in the coming weeks I will decapitate the consultants I hired for my web service project.Or perhaps I will force them to buy the book and read it on their dime, not mine.
__label__1 A beginning, a muddle, and an abrupt end: The numerous "Twilight Zone" references in these reviews should be seen as a negative, not a positive. Original episodes were 22 minutes -- for a reason... the stories could not sustain the willing suspension of disbelief longer than that. Witness the numerous misfires when the show was expanded to an hour. Carroll's book crashes and burns early for the same reason... among others: a nasty, unprepossessing and utterly passive lead character who settles for being told everything rather than discovering anything; the abandonment of another main character in mid-tale; and a completely rushed, totally undeveloped finale. The tale literally just stops -- dead. An extremely unsatisfying read.
__label__1 Bringing the worst out of the American Spirit: Terrible - just simply terrible. Denying all that made America great - turning the country into a fortress of mediocracy. Avoid.
__label__2 Gift: Bought this as gift for a brother years ago. I haven't heard any complaints. It was shipped and received on time and in good condition.
__label__2 The Fast and The Furious: I have watched this movie several time and though it was great. Because I was not that knowledgeable about street racing I did not look for details to pick at. I just set back and enjoyed what I thought was a very good movie and I think Paul Walker did a great job as an undercover agent for the FBI and local police to get to Dom (Vin Diesel) which I also thought he was very good. The street racing was exciting and very colorful.
__label__2 works exactly as i expected: this works just as i thought it would. i can only hear the tape making noise when the volume is at its lowest setting, but usually road noise drowns it out completely and with the volume turned up to a comfortable level you cant hear the tape at all even when the cars not running. i did accidentally hit the skip button on my cassette player and it wouldn't stop searching until i turned the radio off and turned it back on, but that just may be a flaw with my cars radio (94 crown vic lx stock radio) I use this for my ipod classic and my only complaint is the headphone jack is a 90 degree elbow rather than straight so the wire comes out at a strange angle but that's fine. i prefer this to the FM transmitters because i never loose reception or get other stations cutting into my music. the sound is great, far better quality than i expected.
__label__2 Great product: This is a really exellent product. It is simple and really works well. This makes keeping litter boxes clean much easier.
__label__1 The step on thing allows small toes to get CAUGHT!: The step on thing allows small children's toes to get CAUGHT in it!Very Dangerous if you have small children!
__label__2 Hilarious: I think this movie is one of the best ones I've ever seen. Those guys are awesome together and I never get tired of watching it!
__label__1 Lizzie Put It Best: RE: AUDIO TAPE VERSION. I love Follett - when he gives his best effort that is - but this novel smells like quick paycheck. Forgettable characters and predictable action leave the reader with the same response that heroine Lizzie has to her wedding night: Is that all there is? The weak title should have been a clue that this would be a second-rate effort. For a much more compelling period piece from Follett, try the excellent "A Dangerous Fortune".
__label__2 It's a reprint: I'm looking into returning the book itself, just because I already own American Shelter from 1981, and it is the EXACT SAME BOOK. If you don't already own it, it is a great reference.
__label__2 I needed this: As a Catholic boy growing up I always heard about the sacrifice God made for us by sentencing His only Son to death. But it was never something that hit home. I thought, "Yeah it's horrible to lose a son. But thousands upon thousands of people lose loved ones every day." Simplistic I know. What with growing up in an age where one's senses become so jaded from an oversaturization of media and from a disheartening desensitization to violence, sex, and profanity, it sadly (but thankfully) took a Hollywood blockbuster movie to help me realise that God was not only losing His only Son, but losing Him in the most painfull way possible. I now understand with all my heart what Christ went through to save us. This was the worst death I've ever seen. And it was done for you and me.
__label__2 Great movie: I am a huge fan of comic book related movies. This one will not let you down very fun to watch.
__label__1 Terrible Quality, Huge let down: I've never had any real issues with products from Amazon. However,this was a huge let down. The clipper came and looked used (with bits of hair all over it) just like one of the other reviews had warned. Also the free trimmer broke after about a week. Wahl is a great clipper producer, but this product was second hand and sold as new. STAY AWAY.
__label__2 Fantastic: This series is fantastic. I used to watch the Twillight zone marathon every new years eve, and came on amazon to try and see how much it would cost to buy the whole series. I had recieved this as a christmas present so now I have the first season and Cannot wait to add on!
__label__1 A lot of hype, but it quickly fizzled: Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator. Apparently, TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website. However, the calculator is complicated to use, and you almost need a course to learn how to use it. Furthermore, the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out. But let me assure you they are definitely there, and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead.
__label__2 BEST Soundtrack in years!: This is the best soundtrack since, Jerry Maguire! The new songs from Tom Petty and Lindsey Buckingham are worth the price of admission alone!Even better will be the "SCORE" which will be released October 11th. Nancy Wilson's acoustic expertise is soothing, refreshing and a beautiful instrumental masterpeace!!!
__label__1 A poser at best: We all know that Swiss Cake Rolls will never achieve the delicious status enjoyed by Yodels, but I really do give them an A for effort. The major complaint with these snacks is that they are just too dry. They attempt to surround creme filling with some kind of chocolate cake, but the result comes off as a cheap tasting joke. I don't really have any advice for Little Debbie to improve this product, though. They should simply leave it up to the experts at Drake's Snack Foods.
__label__2 Great ball in high wind areas: This ball was not as bright and shiny as hoped for. It is nice non-the-less. There is a mold line that runs around it. It is good in an area if you have kids or animals that might knock over a glass ball and break it.
__label__1 One of the worst movies I have seen...: Don't waste your money on this one! The plot was severly lacking and the acting itself was less than desirable. The movie had a few "almost funny" moments but this didn't make up for the rest of the time.
__label__1 you get what you pay for: I wasn't going to review this item, but this is the second email I have been sent to review it.I used this product one time, it broke and it is now in the garbage. It didn't work, just made a mess.If I want to make Spaetzle I will need to get a real maker, like my mother in law.
__label__1 Just Another Useless Revisionist History: Sorley adds nothing new to the 30-year-old pile of Vietnam Warrevisionist histories. He simply trots out the standard military lineof "we were winning, but the darned [President, politicians, media, protesters, drugs -- pick one or more] made us lose!"Claims of exploring new intellectual territory with important new sources are just sales hype. Touted of being "unique among histories of the Vietnam War in that it focuses on the second half of the conflict" ignores the obvious fact that one cannot analyze this part of the war in a vacuum -- the earlier years had tremendous influence on the conduct and success of later years.This book isn't even worth reading as an intellectual exercise -- as with all its revisionist predecessors, it's insulting to the complex and tortured reality of the Vietnam War.
__label__2 My Purchase: I was very pleased. I got a good deal and didn't have to worry about recieving it in false conditions than stated before bought. I ordered expediant and recieved my book very quickly
__label__2 Picks up where Definetely Maybe left off: Oasis keeps it rolling on their second album. Amazing blend of tunes that makes an hour fly by. It's a bit smoother than the first, but just as powerful. I wouldn't say they are the second Beatles, but at times they do sound a bit like them.
__label__1 Good, yet unsatisfing....: Monkeybone has an interesting premise, but fails to fully follow up. The scenes in Downtown are fantastic, and the stop-motion on Monkeybone is great, but some of the acting skills are sub par. Chris Kattan was wasted in this film, having virtually no funny moments. Perhaps it was a blessing he was only in it for 15 minutes. McGowan's character of Kitty is fantastic, but her role is never really fleshed out as much as it could have been. Still, her moments in the movie are memorable. It is not a bad movie, but it is one that I would recommend renting first, as many will be dissapointed.
__label__1 0 STARS FOR THE MOVIE, AND 5 FOR LEE: THERE IS MUCH BLATANT GREED APPARENT HERE CONCERNING THE LACK OF CREATIVITY AND THE OBVIOUS EXPLOITATION OF LEE.THE FOOTAGE OF LEE SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED IN A DOCUMENTARY OR THE LIKE. K.A.
__label__1 dead in a week: After one week they just felt apart. Waste of money. Better go with the different brand i guess.But the idea is good.
__label__1 Wont Play unless you have BD Live: Horrible! Why do i have to have an internet connection for this to play! At least mention it in the back info pane on the Blu Ray cover. WRONG WRONG WRONG UNIVERSAL! Better fix this for Back to the Future!
__label__1 Beware! Comes in a clear bag with no label: VERY disappointed! These came in a clear plastic bag with NO label. No ingredient list and NO info on where the candy was manufactured. The candy arrived in broken pieces and the bag was full of powder.
__label__1 Solid musicianship, unoriginal songs: I've followed this band since its inception. No doubt Kory's greatest strength is his marketing ability. His music, for whatever reason, does move people. However, I do believe its premature to bill him as the "Midwest's next great songwriter" I can play three chords and tell the world how great my life is too. Now that you've got the resources guys, push the envelope a bit.
__label__1 compact size: it's such a cutie,shame the batteries don't last long enough for you to use it properly.also i can't get to grips with the settings before i take any pics,otherwise a real bargain.something to give the kids to let them learn how to use,so they can show me.I CAN'T KEEP STILL TO TAKE ANY STILL PICTURES.
__label__2 This is Okay: When I first tried this I did not like it. However, after trying other products, by Dentek, The Doctor's brand and sport guards, I returned to the sleep right select. The difference with this is that it works to correct the bad habit of teeth grinding and jaw clenching. You have to unlearn this behavior and in the meantime this protects your teeth. It's important to practice the lips together teeth apart so you catch yourself grinding (usually in traffic for me). It does seem very expensive for a piece of plastic, but when compared to the $700 dentists charge for custom guards, this is not so bad. Even if you have to buy more than one a year it still works out cheaper.
__label__1 Review: We purchased this product but are unable to use it because you can not see anything on the screen, my son was very disappointed in this product.
__label__1 More Hate, Fear and Lies by Ann: Ann along with many of the other worshipers of Hate, Fear and Lies (Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Pat O'Reily, John Hagee, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell,the people who buy into and enjoy this garbage , Newt Gingrich, etc,etc)is at it again making a ton of cash from her fellow worshipers of Hate,Fear and Lies. If you are one of those who agrees and enjoys Ann's rantings, you should also pick up Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, or borrow it from someone at your next worship session.
__label__1 Cover is Too Tight: Loved the look of this case. Color is very pretty. Cutouts in the right places. But I had one major problem with it, it was so tight that I really couldn't snap the cover closed. If I tugged and pulled and finally did close it, I had a lot of difficulty getting it back out! I ended up not using the case.
__label__2 Good movie, didn't glamorize Ruth!: I think this was a good solid movie. Babe Ruth was a legend, no doubt, but all that glitters is not gold, and his life was no exception. I think that by watching this movie you can see why the Sultan of Swat was the way he was, as far as his temper, his low self-esteem at first, his overgrown sense of his own self-worth toward the end of his career. I thought John Goodman played a fine Ruth and while he did appear excessively heavy and slow for the part, Ruth was not a slim, overally muscled athlete in the 1910's. Perhaps, the "dirty" scenes another reviewer commented upon were the scenes dealing with Ruth's flatulence! Overall, it was a good movie, my kids were able to watch it and enjoyed it and I think Goodman did a great role as The Great Bambino. This movie tells it straight, doesn't over glorify him just because he was who he was; afterall, he like the rest of us, was human.
__label__1 Disappointing: I found this a rather disappointing tome, given its weight. In many cases it merely lists the obvious at great length. The index is poor, and the organisation is confusing. I found the lack of tips and absence of special insights frustrating as these have been good a feature of previous reference works like Windows 95 Secrets by Livingston & Straub . I wonder at whom this bland work is really targeted. Best to look elsewhere for a main XP reference. I regretted my purchase.
__label__2 Excellent resource: This book provides both pedagogical and practical assistance in writing letters in the Japanese style. It includes many example letters, and lists the proper "stock phrases" that are a critical part of Japanese letter writing. If I have any complaint, it's only that the text runs out too quickly--I find myself wishing for even more exposition and examples from the authors' excellent style.
__label__2 Just looking for bang-it-up action?: Hopefully not, because this film doesn't go for mass entertainment by means of hopelessly unrealistic action scenes; rather, this classic adaptation of the famous crime novel is stylishly photographed, strikingly directed, and sincerely acted. This version was a prominent example of great cinematography in my HUM205 cinema class. Watch it with an attentive eye and you will no doubt agree!
__label__1 Coffee not hot enough: Reading the reviews and the high price led me to believe this is close to a flawless coffee maker. The problem is, the coffee insn't nearly hot enough and we have to use another source to heat each cup. We've tried the highest heat setting and the 1-4 cup button which are both supposed to make the coffee hotest and nothing works well enough.
__label__2 GROW your kid early!: I bought this for my nephew at 2 1/2 years of age. Do you know that he could say the state of Texas, and recognize the little pieces like New York, Vermont, etc. just because of this puzzle. It is very appealing to toddlers.
__label__2 a girl you want to know: Avril is a young talented artist who has so much potential. the reason that i love her music is because i can really relate to it of course being a teen ager and she also just speaks her mind. but probably the one thing that i like most about her is that she could care less what people think about her and she does what SHE wants not what anyone else wants!! she is an awsome singer. I love her!!!
__label__2 None: My daughter who is in fourth has been assigned this book for their class reading and is enjoying it ver much.
__label__1 Will Smith blows: Will smith is the crappiest "rapper" ive ever heard of. Buying this album was a huge mistake. every song sucks. he just a fake piece of crap actor who does nothing but brag. if you want real rap then go listen to 2pac or Snoop Dogg. No one buy this awful cd!!!!!!!
__label__1 It appears he found the world to be quite boring...: I have tried on several occasions to read this book. I have a problem with deliniating Duffy's style from his technique. Duffy's novel seems Proustian, but I'm not sure if his usage of long-winded and overly ruminative passages is his own style or a technique he intentionally employs to depict a trait he associates with philosophers. This aside, I thought the plotline of the novel was almost without significant incident which seemed remarkable to me since their respective biographies of Wittgenstein and Russell are fascinating. Wittgenstein and Russell were vibrant and tremendously interesting men, but this novel nearly succeeds in portraying them as stodgy and completely self-absorbed beings.
__label__2 Excellent Buy: I bought this for a Christmas gift for my 14 year old grandson and he loves it! It has helped him develop an interest in science that he never had before!
__label__2 Great for replacing missing earbud covers!: I bought this set strictly to replace my Sony Earbud covers (which these work well - the silicon piece - for replacement since you really can't buy just the covers). The case that comes with them work great and it's small so you can throw it in your purse. Since then I have found that these fit well on my Apple earbuds, my motorola earpiece for my cell phone and pretty much anything else. Well worth the $10 you are buying it for!
__label__1 Not what i had hoped for: I had hoped this product would improve or eliminate some of my spider veins..it did not.
__label__1 Poor Navigation: The Index does not allow locating a specific book and chapter such as 1 John 1:1 or even 1 John. This renders this cumberson and difficult to use. Needs a better navigation system.
__label__2 A worthy effort: Though not the full-on Alien sequel or prequel that true Alien die-hards had hoped for, Prometheus is nonetheless a more than worthy effort and a return to form for the Grandmaster of Science Fiction, Ridley Scott.
__label__1 Absolutely horrible: This movie is insipid, stupid, and dull. When I saw Gone in 60 Seconds, I thought I had seen the worst movie I would ever see. I was wrong. Swordfish is all flash (and not really very interesting flash) and no substance: terrible plot, worse acting, and awful directing. Hugh Jackman's character "hacks" 128-bit encryption in mere seconds. Interestingly, in real life this takes hundred of SUPERCOMPUTERS months to do. I don't want to nitpick, but it wouldn't be hard to come up with plot elements that were more interesting AND more realistic.
__label__1 VERY DISAPPOINTED Son on Christmas last year: I bought this toy for my 7 month old son and that same day - it broke! Replaced batteries - no go! so it was sad to say he didn't get to enjoy this bogus toy.....
__label__1 what the hell...?: alright.. umm... I'm not sure what the hell happened here... but, I'm pretty sure this CD had WAY LESS EFFORT than it should have had... I use to enjoy Good Charlotte's first CD (I would easily give the first a 5 out of 5), and only a little of the second one, but this is pretty pathetic. I'm not sure who they are trying to impress, but, I guess if you're a little 13 year old with no sense of real originality, you probably love this album.. as for the rest of us, just go pick up a different CD... hell anything punk right now is far superior to this, even if its sucky wanna-be punk... cuz this sure as hell isn't anything close to 'punk'...
__label__1 Scarpetta Running on Fumes -- Weak Effort By Cornwell: It seems like the Kay Scarpetta series is losing steam. The motivations of the main characters, Scarpetta, her niece, and the rest of the gang, seem to all have one last twist in them, but the plot really doesn't hold together well.It is hard to keep a series going with the same basic characters and keep it interesting, but it seems like Cornwell has run out of ideas and is going through her files to churn out a few more books.I'm glad the book was in a remainder bin. Read the earlier efforts in the Scarpetta series instead.
__label__1 Its possible to over-remaster: This is a great collection of Leadbelly songs. It had a few I hadn't heard before. However whomever remasterd this disc went a little overboard. Reverb is added to most of the tracks. At times way to much. Some of the tracks also clip a little when lead gets real loud. Though not much. I wouldn't recommend this album for the purists. Only the obssesive collector.
__label__2 Can't Get Enough: This game had alot of flaws(the less than perfect fielding, and the lack of a fantasy draft), but it's by far the best baseball game out there. The pitching interface and control is completely original and is the best I have come upon in any baseball game. The batting controls are realistically challenging(depending on what difficulty you play on), and you have to develop an eye for ball and strikes to be successful. Like the pitching the batting is also completely original from that of other games. The best part of MVP is the graphics, which are completely amazing. Being a redsox fan, it was the best damn Fenway Park I have ever seen. I you like baseball go buy this game right now. It's wicked awesome.
__label__2 Buy this movie!: Every American, including the politicians, should see this film! The film contains devastating facts about the Bush Regime and their war on Iraq, and backs up the information with credible sources. If there are reviews that criticize this film, ignore them. The authors have to be out of touch with reality. You must see this film, and decide for yourself. And show it to everyone you know. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 Beautiful and the price was right!: Without leaving home, I got exactly what I wanted and it was promptly delivered right to my mailbox.
__label__2 People can make a difference: This Newbery Award winning book is based on the true story of the Danish people. The Danes saved over 7000 Jews during World War II...other countries took stands against the Nazis, but the Danes proved that people can make a difference.Annemarie was just 10 years old, and may have been the bravest little girl in Europe and she didn't even know it...Annmarie learns that courage comes with convictions and soon realizes that she can survive the brutality of the Nazis and save her friend Ellen Rosen.A wonderful historical note follows the book that just really places the book in terms of history.Another book that is a great read-aloud for home and the classroom.
__label__2 Ok for leather seats!: I puchased this to go under my carseat and I too brought my car to the state police to have it installed and they did not say not to use it for the car. Infact I have leather seats and it actually stops the carseat from sliding because of the grips on the bottom of it! Overall it has saved my seats and has not allowed the carseat to move! I would buy again in a heartbeat!!
__label__2 Awesome music for any mood.: The songs by Dave Matthews Band have great sound and rythim. Good for listening to for whatever mood you are in from sad to happy to mad. I love it.
__label__2 Multicultural Teaching Tool: This book is an excellent resource for those looking to provide a more multicultural education for their child or students. It focuses on the similarites across cultures rather than the differences. It is the story of a little girl who misses her mother. We can all relate to that.
__label__2 if you take world heritage & world culture seriously: The "Report to the UNESCO" of the year 1990 was written by an international group of experts. They give a short (and consequently incomplete) overview of world cultures, comprised in chapters ("The North American Culture") This is NOT a travel guide or an academic research. The book is a report praising the diversity of our planet, giving enough reasons to wish it would always stay that way.10 years after the report was written, the globalization debate renewed the need for initiatives supporting all different cultures and traditions. In the foreword, UNESCO's ex-general secretary Frederico Mayor states it clearly:"Save the world cultures!"Recommended for everybody interested and engaged in world cultural affairs.
__label__2 One of the best 2-disc collections for real disco!: Salsoul Orchestra was best know in the disco circles of the 70s, and the sound has not faded. On the contrary, you can thank the mind boggling downhill mode of RAP for making the sounds of disco sound so, so much better in this day & age! This two disc CD is a must have not just for those who lived and grew up with the Salsoul sound, but for those who want a chunk of dance musical history at it's best.I noticed this Anthology is scarcely available, & I'm glad I got my copy many months ago. Fortunately, Youtube has lots of Salsoul Orchestra posts for many samples, but by all means, grab this collection while you can, it is great stuff.
__label__1 Not for Beginning Programmers!: This book is being used as a textbook in my J++ class. I'm a programming student with experience in Visual Basic 6 and HTML, so I'm not entirely new to programming, yet I found this book very frustrating and difficult to understand and follow. It assumes the reader has a grasp of C++ and a good background in programming. No "step by step" code, no clear "hands on" procedures in the early chapters and way too much technical jargon for the true beginner to follow. If you are a novice and really want to learn J++ save yourself time and aggravation and follow the advice of a friend of mine and try "Using Visual J++ 6" by Scott Mulloy instead of this book.
__label__1 Even the rated version was incredibly obscene: I watched barely 1/4 of it. My husband watched a little more than that. It had more f bombs than any other movie you could possibly imagine. I was prepared for some nastiness but thought since it was the rated one it would have been a bit better.....wrong. Even IF I blurred out the vulgar in it, it wasn't too incredibly funny. It could have been a great movie if they didn't make it entirely for drunk young fools!
__label__2 Carlson extra wide gate: This gate works great. With our wide hall, this was the only walk thru gate that works easily and fits just right. We added panels, so our puppy would stop sneaking through the bars.
__label__1 Typical: Typical Hollywood time travel movie. Predictable. Too much foul language that detracts from the dialogue and plot. Only redeeming part is the performance of the little boy as Sid. He definitely has a future in acting!
__label__2 Word....: This is a H-O-T album...If you like your music to have some variety, which Hip-Hop has been lacking lately, cop this album...I'd say its their second best effort...next to Aquemini of course...anyone who's been listening to OutKast pre-1999 (or Pre-Ms. Jackson) would agree...Still this album is one fire...
__label__1 Disappointing: I started Nickel and Dimed with high expectations because I had hear such good reviews. I was in for a major let down. I did not feel sympathetic as the narrator "struggled" through her low income life. She complained constantly and showed an eagerness to quite when something got tough. She never settled into any one job or place, creating extra hardships of constantly being the "new girl".I think the author meant well in her attempts to show how the lower class lives however, her endeavor fell flat, leaving the reader unsatisfied.
__label__2 In need of under counter real estate: I built a storage desk from a counter top that I bought. Originally this main intention wasn't to be a computer desktop, but that's what it has become.The height of the desktop is slightly over the typical keyboard height. I bought a keyboard tray but it did not have enough room for a keyboard and mouse.I really wanted to have room for keyboard, mouse and my N52TE gamepad. My solution was to buy Logitech Compact Keyboard K300 along with Accessory Universal Keyboard Shelf. I couldn't be happier with not only the fit, but with the stability of this new tray as well. This is now the perfect height for gaming and for work.
__label__2 Great for the price.: I forgot my headphones at home one day, and needed a cheap pair to keep at work for such... emergencies.Surprisingly good bass response, the ability to pick some highs out - a little muddy in the midrange - but... for $12 (not online) - these are quite a deal. They're at least as good as iPod stock headphones.The cord is a little short, and they do feel a little cheap, but hey - they are cheap! They just don't sound like it - which is all that counts, in my opinion.
__label__2 Dessert a la Mr. Food: I've been a fan of Mr. Food for more than a decade. Don't know how he does it, but his simple and easyrecipes turn out delicious food that looks as though you slaved all day in the kitchen. You cannot go wronginviting Mr. Food Makes Dessert into your kitchen.
__label__2 Not the Morgan your mother told you about: If you ever read any Authurian Romance and thought 'hey they really give that Morgan le Fay the shaft!' this is the book for you. Its long, but everyone I have ever asked, including myself, has enjoyed every minute of it. Now that you probably saw the movie, know this: the book kicks major butt to that movie.
__label__1 5 Stars for Gunsmoke 0 Stars for Greedy Paramont: I was anxiously awaiting the release of the second season, but like most fans was disappointed at the level of greed at Paramont. They did the same with Rawhide season 2. Though I desperately want season 2 (and all future seasons) of both Gunsmoke and Rawhide, I will never buy them until Paramont stops being so greedy. I hope when they see sales plummet, the person responsible will be fired and fans will be able to get full seasons at a reasonable price.
__label__2 The Secrets...: For someone who is a poor networker (lets just say introvert) like myself, this was a very interesting book. It showed me a different way of looking at relationships. I think that for people who are not naturally extroverted, and network-savvy, this is a good book.It doesn't really tell you any "secrets," like "to get Larry David to come to your kid's birthday party, do ____." But he does clearly lay out some not-so-unknown-but-still-needs-to-be-said things like "don't be a wallflower at an industry conference" - network, and get to know people as people - not just as the guy who can fix your printer. That guy certainly has other interests than printers.
__label__1 Poor, Nasty, Brutish and Short: Author Strathern went too much for humor and sarcasm and left us with a short but unhelpful tome. Of the 59 pages of commentary, the first 20 or so were brutal to ge through, as Strathern focuses too much on trying to be funny and sarcastic and too little on teaching us about Locke's life and thinking. The latter part of the book does this, but it is too superficial and assumes too much prior knowledge from the reader. It is hard enough to keep track of who sat on the British throne let alone how Locke's ideas were influenced by those who preceded him and how he influenced those who followed; it is particularly in the latter where Strathern fails. I would not even recommend this as an introduction to Locke, unless one is interested in some of the more personal aspects of his life.
__label__2 S.D.H.: I've really enjoyed this one so far. Most the other reviews aren't very good. Frame rate seems to suffer some but from what I've found it's still very playable. Lots of destroying bots and property. Game play in deathmatch is at a breakneck pace and you must move or die quickly. I like the graphics also even though I can't run them up at where I'd like.
__label__2 Musically diverse: Henry Rollins returns to the scene with the members of Mother Superior for the one year follow-up to 2000's "Get some go again". This album continues the diverse music that Henry and the fellas explored on the previous release. "Gone inside the zero" highlights the track list- lightning fast and explosive. "Your number is one" is another standout track with great drumming and percussion work, an extended version of this song can be found on "A nicer shade of red". "Going out strange" is a brooding number that will find its way in your head all day. The music for the most part is very fast and high tempo with a few songs mixed in to slow down the pace just long enough to build up for the next wave of rocking. The album work is classic Rollins- a naked woman(probably a porn star) on the front with money falling over her body and on the back, Henry with his hat on backwords sweeping money up off the floor.
__label__2 Short Review of A Christmas Carol with George C. Scott.: It was like being transported in time back to 18th. Century England. I find absolutely no fault with this movie and would rate it as the best rendition that I have ever seen. Geo. C. Scott is outstanding as "Scrooge" as is David Warner as "Bob Cratchit." The special effects and cinematography are excellent. My children do not feel like it is Christmas without watching this movie. It is or will be a classic.
__label__1 Piece of Junk!!!: My canon Multipass F50 was amazing. After 5 years I retired it and got the MP830. I use both machines for business. In the 2 years I've owned my mp830 I have had to have canon replace it twice becasue of error 5100. The machine simply does not work well. What a headache this has caused me. I will never buy canon again.
__label__1 From Hell They Came: This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, everything about it is weak and incoherent. The acting is absurd, the costumes even crummier and the story is non-existent. This 'poverty row' sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that "Beastmaster" and "Conan" enjoyed but it doesn't give us any reason to follow along. The lead character is tepid and dull, he can't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th Century. All the action sequences are like that, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse. Don't even bother with this crap.
__label__1 -H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E-: The Family Stone was a well-made movie, but at the same time it was horrible. It is a movie I love to hate. I was intensely angry at the family who was so mean to Meredith. Within the first thirty minutes of that movie, I hated the entire family. They were horrible to someone they hardly even knew. I felt sorry for poor Meredith throughout the movie. No one understood her and she had trouble communicating with a family who had nothing in common with her. Overall, the message behind the story was clear. It said that being liberal is the only was to go, and you can conform or die. The way Meredith was treated as a conservative was despicable. Honestly, it was sad how no one gave her a chance from the very beginning, and the ending was probably one of the worst of all time. The ending was TRULY horrible, and made me regret watching the movie in the first place.
__label__2 caged aggrevation: The item arrived and upon opening it, one would think all you had to do was to pull on the sides for it to open via it's hinges. Well, mine was not that easy. The wire ends were tucked in and under other wire and it was hard to tell what was what. I had to use a screwdriver to dislodge a couple of areas to get it to open. Once finally opened, I had to force corners to line up so the cage would be squared and work properly. The minimal instructions were inside the difficult to setup cage. Once the aggravation was over. I had a nice cage.
__label__2 good design, fit's comfortably: I've been using this toy for about 10 years. I replace it with a new one each year for cleanliness. I've never had the straps break. I don't know how people aren't raving about this toy, it's the only one of it's kind that doesn't have hard plastic around the bullet, it's soft and squishy. Some of the other "butterfly" products that are similar can't be used during sex with a partner because the hard plastic is annoying and uncomfortable. I think this product works best in doggy style but it can still be used in missionary because it's soft enough that it doesn't grind into you. As a female I like it a lot, it's a girls pleasure toy but my bf likes the vibration too. I only wish it was cordless, too much wire going on. The bullet comes out of the heart so you could put a wireless bullet in there actually.
__label__1 worst game ever: Could this possibly be the worst adventure game ever?Granted I did'nt finish it but who would want to.Clumsy game controls(you use the keyboard not the mouse)terrible character animation no soundtrack music whatsover to set the scenes.If you wat to buy a real adventure game buy "The Longest Journey".This just stinks.
__label__2 A gore-fest with laughs!: Only H.G. Lewis and Troma could produce something so sick, twisted, and hilarious. I'm looking forward to to season 2. Sally and her brother are going to go down as great cult classic characters. Campy fun for gore and Troma fans of all ages. Check it out!
__label__1 Journeys Through Bookland Volume 1: I have tried twice to purchase this item. Both times the company advertising the book did not have the book for sale. Each had other volumes of the series but not Volume 1. The error was caught once prior to shipment. Once the wrong book was shipped and had to be returned. I am still looking to purchase the book.
__label__2 Reminds me of the way books were written years ago.: I love the characters in this book and their resiliency in spite of the dark side of others and their bond to each other. I love to read historical novels to get a feel for what it was like to live in those times and this book satisfies in that area.
__label__1 Good start, Poor End: First, this book lists all the author's successes in great detail, but wants to only provide wooly and rather meaningless references to her failures or those clients who are hopeless. Where is the point in that - how can we learn from faults and her insights on poor strategies that we cannot cross reference to our own experience of these firms.Second, the first 40 or so pages are good - stagnation area is very good - but the rest is her successes without much value being added to the reader looking for wisdom.
__label__2 Tot sports T ball set: We got this for our son's 3rd birthday. He likes it a lot. The adjustable part is minor and it knocks over with every hit but it serves it's purpose for fun in the backyard. The storage part is great.
__label__1 DEWALT 735 PLANER: I OWN A DEWALT 735 PLANER THAT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP 4 TIMES WITH FEED PROBLEMS. THE PERSON SERVICING THE PLANER SAID HE COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE PLANER I RAN 4 BOARDS THROUGH IT AND THE FEED ROLLER SEIZED UP AND BROKE THE SPROCKET AND CHAIN ALONG WITH THE COVER. THIS HAS PUT ME OFF DEWALT PRODUCTS. DENNIS WILLIAMS
__label__2 One of the best films ever made!: This film should be shown to every director before he makes and epic, because the sheer grandness of this movie is unrivaled. The cinamography is spectacular, giving us large views of New York City, but somehow keeping us confined in a small three block area in the center of skid row. De Niro gives his usual unremorseful performance, and Woods gives us a ranting and raving Max, which fits perfectly with story. The real stars are the kids who play the young gangsters as they earn their place on the streets. The film is long, but what a great time I have every time I watch it! I owe you, Sergio Leone, you are truely a master of filmmaking!
__label__2 Sturdy and heavy duty: This ladder is much sturdier in person than it looks. I'm quite pleased with the build quality and stability of the ladder. It makes stepping onto the third step more comfortable.The steps lock into place so the ladder won't collapse very easily and the steps are thick and nice and wide. Great ladder for around the house use and occasional house work.Folds very flat for the size and build.If I had to nitpick, I'd say that the utility of the small latch on the top step is a bit hard to figure out (although you don't need to know about it to use the ladder).
__label__2 My Favorite Petz: I purchased this game for my 13 year old daughter and it has provided her with hours!!!! of entertainment. We live on a farm and she really enjoys playing with the "live" animals. But on days when the weather is bad and she can't be outside, I can hear the realistic barking and meowing from the computer. She has so many petz that she has to ask me to help think of new names for them. Thank you for such a great product!
__label__1 Don't waste your money on buying this book: Norma Cantor may be the Emeritus Professor of History, Sociology and Comparative Literature at New York University, but he cannot write serious prose about a serious subject. His writing is infantile; it has numerous editorial errors, frequent repetitions and idiotic references (such as the Plague "threatened the stability and viability of civilization. It was as if a neutron bomb had been detonated". Plain crass.Bottom Line: Don't waste your money on buying this book
__label__1 not even 1 star: I've read plenty of reviews on here for other albums and have been suckered to buy them because of these fools! Do not believe anyone who gives this album more than 1 star (simply because it's the lowest it can be). This album is GARBAGE! I found maybe 2 or 3 songs tops, from both CD's, besides "thief's theme" and "bridging the gap", that were pretty hott. That's a damn shame for a double CD and from someone who's supposed to be one of the illest in the game. I'm a Nas fan and have been since Illmatic, but I wouldn't say this album was worthy of my $16! Save your money for something better. Actually, even if you blew your money on candy or gambling it'd be a better investment than buying this album.
__label__2 The Rage: Carrie 2: I saw this movie a long time ago on television and I was instantly hooked. I loved the first one and normally sequels mess it up, but not this time. This is a sequel worth watching. After searching everywhere for a copy of the movie, I finally found it on amazon with an unbeatable price so I had to get it. I recommend it for everyone who is a Carrie fan.
__label__2 Abe Lincoln: Historical account of Abraham Lincoln's early life. Inspiring speech at the presidential debates. Good filming, and dialogue. Raymond Massey plays Lincoln very well.
__label__2 Best, Most Practical and Succinct Book on the Subject: Of the more than 200 books on the subject of Web Page Creation this one is the best. It quickly and easily shows you in succinct step by step examples how to use templates, make web pages really look good, how to add pictures, translucency overlays, etc. If you have ever thought about doing your own Web Pages, or if you are looking for a gift for a web enthusiast, this is the book to buy! It's an excellent investment!Jerry Warrington, CPC (Certified Professional Consultant) and Financial Planner, Denver, CO
__label__1 Somewhat informative and sympathetic, yet repetitive and...: a little too self-centered. Of course, any book by a m-d disorder sufferer about m-d disorder would necessarily be oriented in in the self. However, KRJ seems bent on repeatedly trotting out her credentials and pedigree to a nauseating extent. I found her to be pretentious.
__label__2 impressive.: me and my brotber have always liked animal fantasies and myths. the way this combines those two is interesting.I love it.
__label__2 love the cast lineup and the writing was tender: I was really excited upon getting this movie because I was in love with the cast lineup once I read the details.10 Years is basically about friends coming together at a reunion and there are many small stories that make up one big theme. Going back to undo what you did and see if you can do it right.Albeit cliche I was impressed how the cast took the tender writing and worked their experience to make this a very nostalgic movie.From the moment I pushed play, I fell in love over and over again with the new character introduced and empathized with their plight. I laughed and I cried and I wanted to know so much even after the story ended.Want something to watch on a weekday, I recommend you try 10 Years.
__label__1 Dependent on a perfect world: I am a renovation contractor. I have used a certain pocket door hardware set (that starts with "J"). Not being available, I purchased this set. It works okay and is similar to the other brand with one critical exception: the latching hardware that attaches to the top of the door allowing for removal is low grade plastic as opposed to metal.I had this plastic latch freeze in place so that I couldn't get the door out for further tweaking. The plastic latching arm would bend and distort but not release from the attachment post of the roller bearing. We tried everything...ended up having to cut it out with a sawzall(!) and obtain a replacement part. I do not believe this situation would have occurred with the metal latch of the competition's product, making it superior IMO.
__label__1 There's a reason you've never heard of it.: TV style production with CGI that any high school art/computer graphics department could create in weeks - this time it's a stalking tree. Help!!Acting from people you've never heard of or that no studios are interested in (translation: over the hill).Directing was adequate given their challenge was filming within a mile or so of what was basically a Boy Scouts camp in some southern US forest.Story retold, perhaps a dozen times, in the past 50 years of a mixed group of scientists and profiteers looking for a lost relic with consequences when they find it. Not too original there!Native Peoples that were clothed with armor (huh!) and body/facial paint that looked like it came out of televised wrestling or the NFL. Truly, comedic relief.Straight to DVD to make up for the $20,000 in production costs.Watch Shaun the Sheep afterwards to cleanse yourself.
__label__2 One of the Most Raw and Unique Movies Ever Made: True stories can drag for me - I guess because they're so believable. But this film is truly unique from its inventive filming, exceptional acting, and vivid scenery to its daring content about a young man making it as a photogrpaher during a gang war in Rio de Janiero. It is a raw, graphic film with disturbing sequences. There is no reprieve from the horrific truth. But for those of us who thrive on riveting stories, it couldn't get better if it had been made-up.I wouldn't say it's my favorite film, but to say I've ever seen one quite its equal or anywhere as unique or perfectly made would be a falsehood. I highly recommend it as it is such a rare expefrience to witness such perfection, but be warned that a strong stomach for injustice and violence (some against children) is a must.
__label__2 classy lighting: Lovely lighting fixture. Nicely tinted shades, beautiful curve to the frame, easy to install. Give touch of class to my bathroom.
__label__1 Harley Hates Women: Harley only cares about what men want.Men getting satisfied,men dominating the marriage.Women are nothing more thansex objects,submissive knitt witts.The book would make ourLord very sad.zero stars!
__label__2 well written, but out of date: Since this book is from 1998, it's quite out of date and doesn't cover many new media or ideas from the last few years.
__label__1 Good Music, but the CD is corrupted ("protected"): Can't play it on your MP3 player, can't play it on your computer, can't make a copy for the car. That's lame. Don't buy it. Record company executives think they can use technology to superceed your constitutional rights. Make it clear you won't buy it.
__label__2 The cd, the song, and everything about it was tight!: The cd was the bomb and all my friends agreed.I dont agree with some of the stuff other people wrote ,but it is thir opion. But to me all the songs were great. But my fave is 808. I think these three girls are the bomb!
__label__2 Functional and Attractive Clipboard: The product was sent in the time indicated. It isin very good condition and is exactly what was stated in the description. It has ample room for storage of papers and markers with a clip on the front to secure papers in place. It appears to be durable although it really has not been used yet.
__label__2 Marvelous! I Loved it!: This video on China is marvelous. I'm a part time travel agent and I love it. I have shown it to a couple of people and they were extremely impressed. Who knows, I might get a few trips booked as a result. The videos were amazing.
__label__2 Definately worth reading and keeps interest throughout .: I am also confused about the disparity in the ratings of this novel. It was similar to a Patterson novel in a futuristic setting. The ending sets up for an interesting sequel. I'll be eagerly awaiting it and disappointed if it's not written.
__label__1 No power: I have a very small yard. I thought this would be a great trimmer, but sadly I was wrong.I purchased this since it was intended to be use by those with small yards, and light trimming needed. The trimmer has no power to it. After about a foot of the area you wish to trim a hour has gone by. Save your money and get a better trimmer.
__label__1 I can't stop crying!!: I absolutely love racing games, and I've never given bad reviews about a game before, until now. I was heartbroken when I rated this game 2 stars (the graphics and my passion of racing games had keep it from being given a 1 star rating). The game is not all that bad, it is not all that great either. The racing needs more speed, it feels that I am racing in slow motion. More cars to choose from would be nice, and along with more courses. Is that so much to ask... (I'm getting teary eyed again).
__label__1 nauseating: For decades, many male professors have made the same excuses for sexual exploitation of their students--to the fury of feminists. To read a feminist using the same rationalizations is both nauseating and infuriating.
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Time With This Pretender: I remember reading an interview article with Joe Louis Walker in Guitar magazine in the late '80s. Among other things, he made a point of disparaging Stevie Ray Vaughan as someone who didn't know how to play blues or even know what blues music really was. Of course, Mr. Louis pointed out that HE knew what blues music was all about. This high-brow, arrogant attitude really turned me off to him as a person and a musician. If Mr. Louis spent less time copying Robert Cray's chops and spent a little more time working on his humility, maybe he could be more than a second-rate guitarist jealous of those who have gone before him to greater mass appeal.
__label__2 Good but with reservations.: I'm ambivalent, especially after reading the section on lin alg in Ch. 9. I used Rudin for my undergrad analysis course (Ch 1-7) and thought the text was great, so much more serious than the other text commonly used at Berkeley, Ross' Elementary Analysis. I've since taken courses in algebra, and when I returned to Rudin to read the multivariate section (Ch. 9), I realized that maybe the text was not all that I thought it was. I'm still re-reading his linear algebra background section, trying to understand his presentation of topics I understand well and that are presented clearly in many texts. I suggest supplementing this text with another that provides motivation and illustrations, something like Pugh's new text (which is absolutely incredible).
__label__2 Another Great Film: Yet another great film from the director of "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert". There are too many "laugh-out-loud" moments in this movie to mention. Loved It!!!!!!!
__label__1 BORING!: I Hate this book! I have no idea what the heck the guy is talking about! I am supposed to act like I am writting a letter or something to the Machiavelli guy but I have no idea what I should say. If anybody can help me it is due on Tuesday the 26th. Thanx!
__label__1 Cant Get Past The Smell!: Great size. Fun Toy, but the smell is sooo strong on this toy that it left our bedroom smelling funny. We woke up the next day & the smell was still there... 3 days later you can still smell it- mind you it was sealed in its plastic case in a box in the closet! We sadly threw it out, the smell was that strong. Too bad bacause its a nice product, but the smell overwhelmed us. I even gave it an alcohol bath to see if it would cut the smell ( its a sweet yucky smell). Nothing worked. So, we used it twice and then had to trash it. Sad
__label__1 Totally waste of my time (and money!): I was hoping some of the reviewers were wrong. At least I was hoping to get some useful samples to connect web/HTML to Oracle database. I am wrong! The whole book is repeating and repeating some concepts/subjects about HTML, database and etc. They maybe good for presentations (managers), not for real people doing the work. When I "finally" read the key chapter 14, Accessing Oracle databases using CGI programs on page 301, I was hoping "this is the chapter" that I was looking for. I was totally disappointed. No explanation of how the cgi programs "query.exe (and others)" connect the HTML to Oracle. Anyway, if you are just getting into web/database business, this book may give you good concepts of it. However, this book is already outdated! I am sorry to buy this book. Hoping people not repeating my mistake.
__label__1 no a true 9": the bracelet was not a true 9 " the necklace perfect the bracelet nice quality just not true to length
__label__2 LOVE it: I LOVE this thing. I found that at first, some of the butter sticks to the little plastic tab that holds the butter stick inside, but you can just manually clear the butter and otherwise I haven't had any issues. If the butter sticks to the slicer, just rub a tiny bit of cooking spray on it (be careful, it's sharp)! I can't believe how much I like having this thing in my kitchen and how often I use it.
__label__1 Crappiest Printer Ever!: Long time Epson user. This is it. I'm moving on never again. I was disappointed in the last one but gave Epson another shot. Worst thing about this printer is the paper handling. It has two functions 1. crooked or 2. empty (when it is not).
__label__2 Ten days to Self-Esteem: 10 Days to Self Esteem is a staple in my practice working with clients coping with depression and anxiety. This is the one workbook where clients will consistently complete the exercises and homework. They have shared that the techniques are understandable and they can see their progress. The Cost benefit analysis is the one technique, however, clients /patients find dificult initially; but then catch on. My clients see improvement in themselves once they go through the entire workbook and that the most important. Thanks so much!Debra Irby, LCSW-C
__label__2 Good book: This is one of the first books i read about BDSM. Much can be learned about so many topics, some of which as so important such as safety. A great book to have in your library.Wayne
__label__1 A review in process: After waiting TWO MONTHS for this fan, it finally arrived, in wrapping that has seen better times.The fan itself looks new. However, the assembly instructions were not in the box.I found instructions on the web, tried to follow them, only to realize that the screw that attaches the blades to the shaft is missing! In addition, there is a rubber sleeve on the shaft which I think is supposed to be removed, although the instructions do not mention this. Lastly, the instructions talk about "clips" that put the grille part together, while the fan I have has clips and one screw+bolt that must be attached to the grille.This being a weekend, I cannot contact Soleus. Tomorrow, I plan to request an instruction manual, the missing screw, and some explanations.I hope to update this review once I have an operational fan, whenever that might be.
__label__1 Requires Way Too Much Effort: This product is almost like a wax for your (interior) glass. Yes, the instructions say "use a clean ... microfiber cloth to buff out excess haze and remove excess material." Unless you're OCD about your cleaning efforts, you'll spend DAYS finding new places where this stuff is still lingering. I'm sorry I didn't heed the previous reviews before purchasing, but the Rain-X Glass Cleaner wipes will cause you way more work than should be required. Windex and a clean rag for me from now on.I've used one wipe out of the package. The rest are now in the trash, since I don't want to mistakenly happen upon them again down the road ...
__label__2 Great DVD: This is a really great concert caught on film. I know it's sad to say but I never liked Gravity until I watched this. John Mayer is a really great live performer.
__label__1 WWF Dreamcast GARBAGE: This game is garbage because of the few modes you can play and limited wrestlers. Sure it is good to get 9 wreslters into the ring at one time and it is kind of fun to fight in the parking lot near the street. But once you play it for a week or less, you get really tired of it. I suggest selling your Dreamcast and buying a PS2 or an XBOX which both have better (wrestling) games. Thats why dreamcast went broke. It had such good potential but the people did not put enough good games. Most were too much arcade like games that you got tired of. The rest was all sports. Well actually mostly all the games are better than dreamcast on the XBOX and PS2.
__label__1 Good fiction: This book is not true, contrary to all those who believe in this nonsense. The Amityville Horror was proven a hoax almost from the beginning. However, it is a good horror story if you read it for what it is- fiction.
__label__2 Another home run horse tale!: Once again, Farmer gives her young readers an engrossing and informative tale about the show circuit. What I like about these books is how Ms. Farmer teaches her readers about the goings-on at these events, all without sounding too boring or "lesson-like". She takes her audience for a roller coaster ride, keeping them enthralled the whole way with a fantastic plot and a fabulous cast of characters.
__label__1 Huge misrepresentation: While the book itself if great, the condition of it is not new, and has a salutation written on the inside of the front cover. Completely unacceptable, and we will not buy from Amazon again until this is corrected.
__label__2 Wonderful: I had been looking and looking for "Nestor" on DVD for years and had just about given up hope when my husband presented me with this DVD on Christmas morning. I actually cried, I was so happy. If you grew up with these stories, they will bring back treasured memories for you. The transfer to DVD is remarkably clear and gives the specials a new life. I'm so glad to have these on DVD to share with my own children.
__label__1 live show: sfu is absolutely terrible. i saw em play in va beach last night and it was sooooooo lame. first off, they have the most god awful stage presence i've ever seen, these guys seriously couldn't get the crowd going above a few kids jumpin around and they were HEADLINING.Second of all,have you ever listened to the lyrics? what fcking dorks, who could take lyrics like," the world makes me sick, tell me what to do, i have a special place for you" seriously or even think thats cool,or the part in that song apocalypse(which i may add is great comedy) where he says,"i want to eat your brain!" This blows completely,oh, and the singer's voice SUCKS. haha,but if you like this,check out millencolin, they rock just as hard.
__label__1 Disrupts WiFi Networks Too: I agree with the other negative comments about how confusing this phone is to use, and how it has mediocre (at best) sound quality. But, the most serious problem for me is that every time someone uses it, it completely disrupts my wireless network. So if you're using 802.11b, stay away from this phone.
__label__2 Great Christmas songbook: I checked out about 20 or so Christmas song books and purchased this one. There are some well-known songs missing but overall this is a great book for both singers and pianists.The reason I put 4 stars is there are multiple version and edition of this book. The first one I purchased was way too easy (easy version). Then the next one I got was for organ. Watch out the small letters on the top to ensure what version you get! Or it could be just me...
__label__1 Not good help for resumes: The book suggests using indents and tabs to make a resume. Using tabs would make things bump around strangely if you edit or change font. No mention of using a table and turning off the lines to make placing text and editing easy. Resume they do make is not a great-looking document, and has (for my field) awkward formatting (like the year buried at the end of the line). No mention of Word's online resume templates. I'd hoped to have this book as a reference for students, but the suggestions in here are things I'd tell them NOT to do. Skip this book. Get a good book on using Word, and Robin Williams excellent book on graphic design tips, "The Non-Designer's Design Book".
__label__2 This band rocks: I saw The Young Dubliners at a free concert in Santa Monica this summer and was so impressed I bought the CD. This album was a delightful surprise. I like every song on it. This is an excellent band that brilliantly combines traditional celtic style and instruments with modern rock n roll. I've listened to it over and over and still enjoy it.
__label__2 Better quality vise than I expected!: I have to admit, I didn't think I would like this cross slide vise. I expected rough castings, poor finish and low level hardware.However, that was not the case with this inexpensive Shop Fox vise.It arrived looking close enough to the pictures that I was relieved about it's finish and after cleaning it up and installing the crank handles, the build quality.It's perfect for small milling tasks in lightweight material or centering holes for accurate drilling.It will not replace your Palmgren or other high end units but considering it's cost, it's a lot better than it has a right to be.Especially with Amazon's Prime free shipping.
__label__1 A Sad Day For Movie Distribution: Easily one of the worst ten films ever distributed. Do yourself a favor and don't waste an hour and a half of your life watching this because you can never get it back,Purchase a classy teenage comedy instead. That movie is better known as 'Zapped'.
__label__1 This thing is more fickle than a 13 y/o girl.: I didn't try to return this because honestly it wasn't really worth the time. I would buy a different product if I were you. There are plenty of them out there.
__label__1 Maybe in the hands of a "professional": I don't know what I am missing. The so-called "razor sharp" blade mutilates citrus fruit and bell peppers (yes, I removed the blade guards). Moreover, the handle is large and awkward to use -- good luck trying to julienne a carrot. I agree with another reviewer who wrote of food waste because of the spikes that stick the food to the handle, if the blade doesn't cut the food then the handle tears out of the food, leaving large tears through it.I am very dissapointed with this, and am returning it. I gave it a fair chance, but someday I am going to need to slice a tomato.
__label__2 It was hell of a show!!!!: I was one of the lucky 70.000 people who had the chance to watch Pearl Jam live that night. It was a grat show because both the crowd and the band itself was very enthusiasted. (I have seen them before in Istanbul). I think some of the solos and Eddie's vocals are a good proof of how the band enjoyed the show as well. This album is a must for every PJ fan because of the raw energy it contains.
__label__1 I wish there were negative stars....: The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).The DVD player completely fails to recognize them. Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed. More Taiwanese junk. (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments.
__label__1 oops! wrong edition: Perhaps my mistake, but I wanted at least a 2003 edition, not the 2001 one I already own. The subcontractor told me I can return the one I got, but I presume it will cost me more in shipping than a copy would cost me here in town.
__label__1 *******SUFFOCATION RISK ******: I BOUGHT THIS ITEM B/C BABIES DO LOVE THE TAGS ON THINGS BUT THIS EVENING MY 4 MONTH OLD ALMOST SUFFOCATED BECAUSE OF IT! I LOOKED OVER TO HER SITTING ON THE HER BOUNCY SEAT TO FIND THE 12 X 12 BLANKET COMPLETELY OVER HER FACE AND HEARD HER GASPING FOR AIR! I RUSHED OVER TO HER AND THANK GOD SHE WAS AND IS OK! I JUST WENT ON THE TAGGIES WEBSITE TO FIND THE BLANKET IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES AND IS APPROVED BY JMPA, TIA AND ICPHSO. I AM SURE MY BABY IS NOT THE FIRST TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AND I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING THIS ITEM FOR A BABY DESPITE IT BEING RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES. THIS ALSO GOES TO SHOW THAT EVEN THOUGH AN ITEM IS APPROVED BY VARIOUS SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS, THAT MAY NOT MEAN THE ITEM IS IN FACT SAFE.
__label__2 Catchy title yes, but great content: I read this book a long time ago and immediately demanded every woman I knew read it. It's that important. And it's not just for women (although, as the author sadly but correctly points out, they are the recepients of the most violence). De Becker is a (now) famous author specialising in protection; he speaks very authoritatively about it and from reading this and some of his other books, I can understand why: he certainly has the pedigree and experience to do so. The tactics he proffers are simple and quick to implement. It requires nothing more fantastic than common sense (which as we all know, isn't common!). Altogether, this is a great book. Read it and disagree, I dare you! :-)
__label__1 2 of 3 did not work: item showed up quick even tho it was xmas timethese were extra add-on gifts as a result of the recent power outage and thought it be nice to have if needed againOnly 1 worked out of the box the other 2 had to be taken apart and reassembled to get the contact to touch.So now all three WERE working upon gifting these out one failed on xmas . . nice gift . . . for $10 bucks I was not expecting much but a plastic housing with a wire connected to a bulb to a battery seemed simple so $10 should have covered it since I had to supply the batter separately anyway. So one works tested today 1/10/13 one does not. The Third work when opened and was put in a closet not sure if it will light when needed.the pro is they are extremely bright when they actually to turn on - - so the working one is great
__label__1 See it for what it is.: Despite the photo, which is the arm of a fully grown man sporting this metal S-shield, the moment you try to put it on you realize it wasn't made for an adult hand. It barely fit on my pinky, and my hand is far from what's considered to be large. The light itself isn't very bright, blinks sharply and repeatedly for a short amount of time, and is abnormally heavy. More to the point, it's hard to see whether or not this is a toy at all. It's overall design doesn't seem to really fit what's appropriate for a child, but it's certainly not sized for an adult. In short, the ring doesn't really know what it is, and it's hard for buyers to figure out who it goes for.
__label__2 Great: This is an excellent collection of ballads performed by Dave Brubeck. A couple of solo pieces, a lot with paul Desmond, one with Pops, one with Carmen McRae, and one with Gerry Mulligan. Makes for a very relaxing and interesting listen. Take out Kenny G and put on this. ;-)
__label__1 Horrible!: Even for the low price I expected more! Either they gave me wrong parts or bottom legs are defective. Legs do not fit together, which makes it lean far to the side and worthless. Waiting for a refund.
__label__2 he will enjoy this: a small project, and legos are way overpriced, but grandson likes it because it has figure of a person which he uses a lot, he makes many interesting 'things' by mixing these pieces with other sets
__label__2 Worth it: I had the Philips SBC-HP140 for roughly 4 years, great set of phones. I bought the HP170 to replace them at home, and they've been great the past 6 months. I now need 'phones for my lab, and I have no hesitation in plumping for these again - they're a worthy successor to my excellent 140s. Highly recommend. I'd give 'em 4.5 stars.
__label__1 Only one good track: I heard the song Waterfalls (One Love Mix) by East To East on Pandora and loved it, had to buy the song. Waterfalls is the only track on the album worth listening to, the rest SUCK!
__label__2 I am not the author: I learned about this book from my prenatal class and bought it at a bricks and mortar, so I was stunned when making my essentials for baby listmania list to see the controversy surrounding this book on Amazon.Simply put, I think that the negative reviewers say very little negative about the book, but say negative things about the authors. I was on bedrest for nearly 2 months before my son was born and live a very rural area of Wyoming, so I was not able to shop for my nursery items in a traditional way. This book ensured that I bought safe things that I needed. We made wise purchases with the help of the baby bargains book. I think that the real value lies in the fact that we didn't buy things that we don't use.Good luck deciphering though this reviewing mess, but I think the book is a great help if you aren't able to get out and hit the pavement, or are a first time mommy and don't know what you need.
__label__2 Good laptop memory: I have two laptops equipped with two each of these modules. One of them has been using them for more than two years, and the other only relatively recently upgraded to them (less than a year ago). In addition, a friend of mine has also been using these modules for a few years now.In all that time, they have worked very well. Not perfectly, though: one of the six modules failed (after a few years heavy use), but Crucial replaced it reasonably quickly and without issue, and everything is back to running well again. I count off a star for the single failure, but really would have preferred only to take half a star (Amazon forces 'whole' stars) since Crucial gave no fuss about replacing it.Oh, for anybody wondering, IBM ThinkPad A31 and A31p units can support these modules (they run at 333 though, but CL2.5 instead of their nominal CL3 at 400), for up to 2GB system memory. No problems yet on that particular machine.
__label__2 Great book!: This is a great book to teach to kids and everything... Making them explore their new nature. The only little comment is, that I think that there could be a bit more to the book.
__label__1 Garbage: This is the worse software ever. I only wanted to copy a family video to another dvd. No user support, no online or printed help. The box it came in is more useful. I had to rate it one star but it was not even worth that rating.
__label__2 towel warmer: This is the best thing. My towels used to get smelly and mildewy after a bath. I had to wash the towels after a couple of times of use...The warmer saves all that. My towels stay fresh and dry and nice and warm after you get out of the shower...Best thing I've bought in a long time..
__label__2 Purchase of A Million Little Pieces: My experience with purchasing this item was wonderful! Condition of the book was excellent even tho I believe that it was listed as good or very good. Delivery was speedy too! Book review~great book. Adult language. Took an adjustment period to get used to the authors way of writing. No quotations in conversation so it was hard at first to separate speaking from thoughts. I have actually loaned it to 2 other people that have read it and also liked it.
__label__1 Not Funny: Bland ramblings. It seemed funny at the time. . .and the times have changed. Try another disc and forget this one.
__label__1 Disappointed from Texas: If I had read some of the reviews I would never had purchased the book. When I looked at it closely I realized that it was something I really couldn't use because it did not include the up to date building requirements. If the title shown had mentioned 1932 edition it would have helped in my decsion whether to purchase the book or not. One thing I learned was that I need to check and double check before I purchase.
__label__2 Christmas carol: A great remake of the original dickens classic. Jim Carey isn't too over the top. The animation is just beautiful. I picked up the bluray so we can watch it every year.
__label__2 Great for Ezcema!: Baby has ezcema and this keeps her skin soft all day long! It stays on longer than vasoline and doesn't disappear like lotion. This is important if your child is in daycare and may play with toys that have irritants on them! It's also good for diaper rash as it creates a protective barrier and lastly, mommie's dry hands! If you're changing alot of diapers and washing your hands alot this will keep your skin from drying out!
__label__2 a patch of blue: a lasting, timeless masterpiece: i saw this film somewhere years ago and, later, couldn't remember the name of it; but i remembered all the stars and everything else about it and vowed to find it. how this MGM film managed to get overlooked in its day, both at the box office and also at the oscar's, still amazes me.this is a 'must-see' for anyone who appreciates a director with such a deft hand on the subjects of 1960's racism and relationships that he pulls off the rare feat of story-telling without preaching. how was this possible for director guy green? he also wrote the screen-play!P-of-B is filled with poignant truth, gentle but hard won humor, and that Patch of Blue--HOPE.Patch of Blue is a classic...starring sidney poitier, elizabeth hartman, and shelley winters..and worth mentioning in his own right, an amazing actor in a supporting role, wallace ford.SEE IT!
__label__2 Great Buy: Great Price and nothing beats a romance movie! Not great acting or filming but nothing like cheesy romance to bring a smile to your face and help you relax
__label__2 Great book for explaining the modern global economy: An interesting historic account of the rise of containerized shipping, whose success has completely changed the modern world economy. Nothing will ever be the same again as long as container ships are here.
__label__2 Excellent guide: This book has clear and complete instructions for nearly every technique of coloring fabric - dyeing, stamping, stenciling, silk screening, bleach discharge, etc. It's a good source of instructions for bleach discharge, and it has some of the most beautiful examples of combinations of several techniques, for inspiration. This book can be used by a beginner, but it has an immense amount to offer to a more advanced fabric artist.
__label__1 Heavy shipping charge: The product is OK but nothing special. The problem is that Amazon doesn't stock it and passes the purchase to Adorama. Adorama puts an outlandish shipping charge on the simple packet of lens tissues. You would be far better off buying such tissues locally and "carrying" them home.
__label__2 Freddie is the King: How we miss that incredible voice and outrageous personality. This is bliss to see him again. Well put together and footage not seen before, great value for any Freddie fan.
__label__2 The Third Eye: In beautiful New Mexico, there lies Karen. She is a lovely, young lady, but she also has unique powers. She has the ability to track missing children. Karen peers into horrific visions. To her this is a horrible thing, but when her friend's relative vanishes, along with lots of others she has to make a choice. Does she decide to lend a hand using her third eye, or step out of all of the chaos?
__label__2 No wasted carbs, no artificial sweeteners, easily dissolves: I love this product. I mix it with high protein milk for a smooth, creamy, and tasty treat (not sweet, but that's fine by me). I love the fact that it is very low in carbs, that there are no artificial sweeteners, and that it is 99% undenatured.
__label__1 This reads like an outline for a Tom Peters book: If you buy this book, you will end up asking yourself why you spent so much for something that is merely pages and pages of glossy color graphics with very little substance. 50% of its readers could pull these pearls of wisdom from any of the dozens of other career books and, if they had access to a publisher, come out with the same generic summary. Most points are very obvious and come with no suggestions on how to move forward on each point.
__label__1 3-1Grill/Waffle/Sandwich Marker: This is a good idea but it broke the 1st time i used it. A part broke when i was cooking.It let the juice down on the cooking unit.
__label__2 Happy with it.: It trims well and the vacuum really works. I have a heavy beard and have to empty the collection chamber often but yes the vacuum really works. It is functional and handy and trims well. I would give it 5 stars but I don't like changing the head for moustache trimming. Those that complain about the battery life probably didn't charge it fully and use it until the charge was depleted before re-charging. All and all another good Norelco.
__label__1 disappointed: I bought this toy for my 9 year old son who loved it at first but after awhile he was dissapointed. It stopped working correctly on one side. The remote may be the problem, I am not sure. We changed the batteries but that did not help. I felt bad I bought him a Christmas gift that didn't last the day!
__label__1 Broken and Poor Quality: I read the other reviews which stated that this toy came broken and poorly made, but hoped I would receive something with better quality. Well I did not. I did not even have to open plastic on the box to see the rolling pin had a crack in it. The wooden cubes had not been sanded correctly and had jagged wooden edges. I did not bother opening to see what other issues I might find. Per Amazon and their great customer service, I returned this and unfortunately am going to buy a plastic Play Doh toy instead.Do not purchase this item. If I could give this item ZERO stars I would.
__label__2 Not Quite What I Expected: Occupy Wallstreet did do what was intended... I think! I thought it was entertaining, but lacked substance. Basically it showed a bunch of misfits and society outcasts doing what they do best, tearing stuff up and causing trouble. No plot, although its NOT a movie but a documentary about most the people behind the Occupy Wall Street crowd. But it was short lived because people, regardless of how they may describe it, usually tire of this type of behavior pretty quickly and then turn against them, which is what basically happened.
__label__2 Lots of fun for an old classic: This is a great family game, it's easy to learn and fun for many ages...the only con I can think of is that you can only have four people play at once. If they added a few more colors, it could be a good group game as well.
__label__2 Just Back from Cape Cod: Having recently received Sibley's Guide, I took off for Cape Cod, Sibley in hand, accompanied by my well worn Stokes and National Geographic 3rd edition. Mission: Identification of shore and wading birds, fall warblers, gulls. Sibley is a bit big for use as a field guide, but it surpassed the other two excellent guides in its presentation of each bird in its various plumages, by gender, maturity and season. The art work is accurate and second to none. I appreciated the fact that each bird was presented in a consistent profile, bird to bird as opposed to a variety of attitudes or positions. So, while the other guides may make it out into the field, Sibley will at least be close by in camp, the car, the boat for a complete and authoritative answer.
__label__2 Nice, but "organized": At the time, this was just a fun book; now it's a fun remember-when book from before the tech bust.The only thing that I dislike about the book is that it's been "organized" by theme -- whether or not that means breaking up a story arc. It's rather disruptive, especially since the drawing style changed quite a lot (and generally for the better) in the early days. So you're cheerfully reading through a story, and BAM! You're back to scribbles and your story arc is nowhere to be seen.If Peter Zale ever resurrects the strip, I hope that he'll consider a more chronological approach to future books.
__label__2 Nice storage: I bought these to put my daughter's dvd's in. We are a bit short on storage space at the moment so I was glad to find something that wasn't big and bulky. They are really easy to put together and I have found them to be great.
__label__1 Very Disappointed: I was very excited to read this book after browsing the contents at the bookstore. But when I tried to follow along, I was lost. I only got through chapter 2 and I couldn't get the example tutorials to work. I am not a Flash Beginner, so I don't think that was the problem.Unfortunatly, I am returning this book. I felt lost within the "fast paced tutorials" and I couldn't understand how the code was supposed to work. I felt like some additional explanation was missing.I am a tutorial writer myself, and I know how hard it is to write, so I feel bad for giving a bad review.
__label__1 You might get a few good years out of it.: I paid A LOT of money for this tv 4 years ago, so I expected it to last. Last it is not. The screen is slowing being covered in blue. The cause is unknown to us and to Sony and cannot be fixed, so the only suggestion Sony will give is to replace it. Which when we can no longer stand it we will do, but it will not be replaced with another Sony...ever again. Be aware that we are not the only ones with this problem in fact we've heard of much worse cases than ours with this tv. In fact Sony has actually had people purchase replacement bulbs and other stuff that does NOT fix the problem and sticks the customer with the cost of the replacement merchandise!My review on this tv...buy a different one and from another company with better customer service!
__label__2 optimistic realism: This documentary combines a fine objective balance between the realistic frustrations in political diplomacy and the optimistic humanism of a caring peacemaker. Very inspiring, it gives a closer look at the personal dimension in trying to resolve global conflicts.
__label__2 Excellent pan for your everyday baking and cooking needs!: I LOVE to bake, so my pans endure a lot of use and abuse. I typically have to replace my 9x13 pans every 4 years because of the amount of scratches and marring on them, something that shouldn't happen to pans (in my opinion). However, since purchasing this pan almost 3 years ago, I'm thrilled every time I bake! There are no signs of scratches, wear, or rusting; it looks like new (unlike the one I purchased at the same time, which has tons of scratches)! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the silicone handles on each side which insulate the heat from the potholder (and my hands) and make it comfortable to hold. Everything seems to bake evenly and I have never had to grease this pan as the food comes out cleanly and smoothly. If you need a durable and functional 9x13 pan, look no further than this one!
__label__1 What's the Point?: This is by far the WORST book that I have ever read in my entire life! I found it frustratingly hard to follow so much that I found myself asking why in the world am I reading this? and Is Pynchon crazy? There is no discernable plot and I found that Slothrop and his sexual exploits to be obscene and disgusting. I honestly preferred J.G. Ballard's Crash to this book.
__label__1 Does not fit GE coffeemaker: It did not fit my GE 12-cup coffeemaker. It was much too shallow for the basket cavity in the coffeemaker. I don't see how this item has sufficient volume to handle 12 cups of coffee. As others have remarked, the bottom is solid plastic, which would tend to impede the outflow rate of the brewed liquid.
__label__2 Beautiful book: A must-have, obviously, for MIGNOLA / HELLBOY completists, this book is also an introduction to a) the creative process at work in artist MIGNOLA's mind, b) his quest for his unique style. Along the years, "less becomes more" as the emphasis is put on conveying a specific atmosphere in lieu of drowning the reader with details. Not that there is no details in the gothic surroundings of HELLBOY's adventures. There are plenty. The point is that MIGNOLA does not compete with artists in the "super hero" field but with himself. The books praises that. And is good at it.
__label__1 Little iffy: This product turned my water and unit yellow. However it did help my water not smell. so for the most part it did help the water but for some reason discolored my unit.
__label__1 The Worst Thing Ever!!: Dude! Dreamcast is not good. The graphics r worst than the big fat old Gameboy. Believe me and dont buy it. Its a waste of your money. When it first came out, I thought it was good so I bought it and then I found out that it stinks! Now I am sad. So believe me and dont waste you're money on this garbage. Peace Out!
__label__2 excellent, inspiring essays: The title essay was originally a speech given at West Point, and one of Miss Rand's own favorite pieces. In it, she eloquently demonstrates the importance of philosophy in man's life... in EVERY man's life. "...the choice we make is not whether to have a philosophy, but which one to have: rational, conscious, and therefore practical; or contradictory, unidentified, and therefore lethal." This book is for those interested in philosophy, as well as for those who aren't.As Leonard Peikoff states in the Introduction, "Ayn Rand was not only a novelist and a philosopher; she was also a salesman of philosophy -- the greatest salesman philosophy has ever had." Philosophy's purpose is not to impress people at cocktail parties or to "trick" people in debates with ready-to-wear paradoxes. Philosophy is essential to life -- read this book to discover why.
__label__2 A great travel tool: The Popout maps in general are a verry easy to use travel tool.I like the size (greetingcard size) and the information it carry's.The Boston map shows you all the things you want to visit on 4 little maps each for a different area or purpose. and on the back they have a subwaymap.This map is a usefull musthave product for if you are new in Boston. It has everything you need.Georgewww.ghptravel.com
__label__2 Best yet!: While it may not be 100% accurate in step counting (at times it seems to jump up a bit), this is the BEST pedometer I've purchased! The seven day memory is great for tracking progress and challenging yourself. The extra clip procetion strap is a life saver! Overall, this is the best one I've found for the price!
__label__1 Quick read, but don't expect anything wonderful from it: This novella confirms my suspicions that a celebrity should stay away from the literary form. This book should have never received the attention it did--the characters are not likeable at all and represent some of the more pathetic qualities of human nature. The story is filled with the worst cliches imaginable. I was looking for a good romance when I picked it up (not my favorite genre, but once in awhile you get in the mood for it)--I'm embarrassed to say this, but a Harlequin Romance would have been a better choice. Steve is a wonderful actor, comedian, screenwriter, etc.--he should stick with the entertainment industry. I read somewhere today that he is coming out with yet another novella--yippee, can't wait. (!)
__label__1 Worst Iron ever bought: I've had two previous black and decker irons that had worked ok, but this one has got to be the worst one. I bought this iron and used for about 6 months very sporadically, sometimes I would go days without using it. And just two days ago it stopped working. It shorted out. And I tried unplugging it and letting it sit for a while but it just died. Awful purchase, I honestly believe Black & Decker is not making the irons from durable materials like they did before which is a shame. I will not buy another iron from this brand anymore!
__label__2 legendary strikes: Lady kung fu is asome but this movie is for the female kung fu fans for real. But if you wanna see Angela Mao whip some butt check ot the "sting of the dragon fist" or "lady kung fu" and of course she the one who played bruce lee's sister in "Enter the dragon" "Lengedary Strikes...Excellent."
__label__1 Another psychotic ramble: Listen to Ann Coulter talk and you wonder why she isn't taking her medication. Buy one of her books and you've just joined a pschotic nut group.Ann Coulter must be irritated because she could never get Clinton alone. Or maybe it's just that she keeps writing this insane screeds because there's a hard core of nuts who will buy anything that vents their anger.Not worth one star and a waste of money.
__label__1 No TPB Fan: This isn't Shakespeare. I knew nothing of the TPB series before watching the movie and reading the reviews at this site. It seems that TPB fans like the movie because it fits in well with the series. I prefer movies that are realistic. I believe that most people who do dope, drink too much, party hearty at great length, and commit petty crimes for a living are mean-spirited, but the key characters in TPB seem to be basically kind-hearted. In other words, it's hard for me to laugh at the antics of this sort of person, because I know that, in the real world, these antics lead to a lot of pain. Of course, this movie features caricatures of people who engage in this kind of behavior, and there is humor in any human scenario. I gave the film two stars because the acting was solid. The players knew their roles and did yeoman work.
__label__1 It's got Synth-Pop/Techno - but where's the Goth music?: All these Synth-Pop/Techno wanna-be Goth bands have completely destroyed the Goth scene forever.What ever happened to Gothic Rock? When did it turn from something cool to something so lame and predictable? Where's the creativity? All these bands sound alike now. Techno, techno techno, synthpop, synthpop, synthpop. We used to have Goth bands with different sounds within the genre, now all the clubs play this synth-pop and techno stuff, which has absolutely and utterly no relationship with what Goth started out as.I'm sorry but since I have taste and a sense of history I just can't listen to this drivel.Lame - boring - repetitive - soulless music
__label__2 Excellent read for an Aliens Fan: Great read for any scifi/horror fan, a very decent storyline and continuation from where Alien Resurrection left off. Excellent story, characters were perfect. More books like this should be written.
__label__1 controls????: The controls are bad in this game, a big pet peeve of mine is difficult controls, i don't won't to know the "learning curve" for figuring it out either, i know how to play video games. This game seems fun and has some original missions to do around the park. I lost interest after the third mission because it takes forever to try to pin the controls down, call me lazy but I bet the Tony hawk skateboard controller will be easier than this trash.
__label__2 Brewer's Yeast: Product exactly as described; don't know yet if it provides all of the benefits attributed to it!
__label__2 Funniest Thing I've Heard In Years: It probably helps to be over 40 and formerly very confused about America and where she was going. But anyone who enjoys fast-paced absurdist satire will love this collection. A friend bought it for me and I was afraid to open the gift wrap for a week. Today I did and I'm so glad. Their humor is so precise and devastating that many other comics simply pail by comparison.
__label__2 BELL, BOOK AND CANDLE: I WAS AMAZED BY THIS SELLER'S SHIPPING PROMPTNESS. I RECEIVED IT TWO DAYS AFTER ORDERING! THIS WAS GREAT BECAUSE I NEEDED THE PLAY ASAP TO READY MYSELF FOR AN AUDITION WHICH WAS ONLY 1 WEEK FROM THE DAY I ORDERED.THANKS TO THIS SELLER! YOU'RE GREAT AND WOULD BUY FROM YOU AGAIN!
__label__1 Not so hot...: CDs fall out pretty easily after awhile; I would recommend CaseLogic holders over this product, they are more reliable.
__label__2 Profound: This album is profound both musically and conceptually. Each song is beautiful, and could stand alone, but as a full album, each contributes to a grand musical journey that is experimental and lush.Conceptually this album is meaningful to the issues of everyday life, even if it is about battling robots! It's about finding your own personal strength and courage in the face of opposition, and ultimately coming to peace with the universe.Standout tracks are Fight Test, Yoshimi, Do you Realize, Summertime, All We have is now, etc. etc. Actually every song is great. Just buy this album.
__label__2 the Warlocks of the kafir: Warlocks, witches and wretched souls full of foul thoughts, the hexers of the Tremere have caused us great pain. Pay they shall, as they are the only hope of the munafiqun ever to overcome Haqim and his rafiq. But be aware, as thou shalt always know thy enemy and be careful not to let them know too much about thee. Drink the Blood and become One. Drink their wretched blood and seek vengeance for the Curse. Only an Ended Tremere is a good Tremere.-Uther Algaan, Assamite Elder
__label__1 bad bad BAD: It isn't often that I feel compelled to write a review for a book I've read. It has to be either really very good or excruciatingly bad. Unfortunately this book falls into the latter category. I read about 80 pages before giving up in disgust. It isn't that the plot was all that awful, but the writing was so bad I couldn't read it. The Britishisms are stolen from Georgette Heyer, not to mention that the plot bears a striking resemblence to Heyer's "FRiday's Child." But the writing was so shallow and rushed, and each character felt like a caricature from romantic fiction. Frederica, impetuous, striking, tiny, spunky... gag. Her sister, Clarissa a beautiful goddess so vain and mean that she is unrealistic. Not to mention the stereotypical, title hunting, evil stepmother.... How do books like this even get published!? Anyway, I feel the urge to warn anyone who might want to buy this. Don't! It would be a horrible mistake
__label__1 Controversy for profit!: Save your money this one just try's to play off of Holy blood holy grail and the controversy over The Da Vinci Code. I hate to agree with other reviewers but this one was defiantly written for the money.
__label__2 Very impressive and rare information about Okemah: Anyone who is even remotely connected to or has family in the south Phoenix area will appreciate the work done by William E. (Bobby) Burt. The research ended at 48th Street to the east, 32nd Street to the west, Salt River to the north and Broadway Road to the south. Lots of pictures!
__label__2 DaVinci Crib: Received in a timely manner. Instructions were great and easily followed. Assembled in about 1 1/2 hrs. Crib was beautiful, and I know my grand-daughter will love it. Thanks
__label__2 This CD by Myriam Hernandez is exquisitly crafted: a jewel !: Myriam Hernandez has created a masterpiece with her latest album; "Todo el Amor" is a beautiful piece of art, and a showing of Spanish romantic love songs at its very best. Some songs are especially remarkable, such as "Deseo" by Monica Naranjo, and that Myriam Hernandez interprets with a peculiar blending of erotic yet romantic song to her lover. Most impressing of all, is a song written for a woman and sung by a wonderful singer. "Huele a Peligro" is a sure hit, and "No Puedo Olvidarte" is an ode to a long-gone yet unforgivable love. In a nutshell, this album will remain a best-seller and a classic for years to come. I highly recommend this elegant piece of romantic pop by a remarkably mature yet sensitive artist.
__label__1 Wrong title for this Book: The author claims that he, "developed a simple and fast method of fabricating printed circuit boards that doesn't require specialized equipment." If he did, he certainly didn't present it in this book. The SEVEN pages that had anything to do with making PCBs presented one limited method and was based entirely on materials commonly available from electronics hobby stores. And the long list of other materials the author considers necessary (jeweler's drill press, special drill bits, overly-complicated exposure cone, additional software, etchant tank, etc.) makes his version the most expensive I've seen.I've since made several nice PCBs and can plainly state that this book is a dead-end that was plastered with a grossly inappropriate title. Save yourself some aggrivation- buy the supplies and follow the directions. This book won't help.
__label__2 Wayne Dyer shines again: This book is another brilliant work from one of the brightest modern thinkers in psychology, philosophy, and religion. In Dyer's characteristic easy-to-read style, he shows how each and every person can tap into the unlimited source of creative intention and create the kind of personal reality we want. One of his greatest lines (borrowed from modern quantum physics) is: "Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change." This is truely a fabulous read for all those on the path to personal growth and self actualization.
__label__1 Anachronistic: Previous review writers have pointed out factual problems, and that as fiction, it isn't very interesting. What I found the most pernicious error was his character Simon, a Rabbi, mentioning G-d's name, which is impermissible in Rabbinic Judaism.His book Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages is a beautiful and at times helpful book, but is seriously lacking when it comes to Jewish and Arab writers of the Middle Ages. Clearly Dr. Cantor should solicit more assistance from specialists on Medieval Judaism and Islam before publishing his books.
__label__2 I never thought I would like this saga.........was I wrong!: I must have bought the first volume of LOTR a couple of years back and never saw it until I could purchase the last and current DVD. I can tell you I thought it would be hopelessly bloated. It was a surprise when the story came together and we see the main character attempting to destroy the evil ring.I never thought I would enjoy these films so much.This comes from a person who never read the books or cared for the fantasy genre.If you like science fiction and fantasy....This is the saga that inspired them all...there is no comparison...
__label__2 Best Of The Best: If you are a Dallas Cowboys Fan,this is the best of the best. The '90's were an exciting time for Cowboy fans and this video is a review of the best Super Bowls ever played.
__label__1 USED PRODUCT: I ordered a NEW crate! They sent me a beat up/bent up crate that was clearly returned and sent out to me. The ONLY reason that i'm giving it two stars and not one is because after bending/tweaking the crate into shape, it's served it's purpose without harming my puppy. I feel i'm being generous.
__label__1 not what i thought: i didnt think i was going to be learning things about sluts, i bought the book because i thought it was going to be a story of a girl who was promiscuous and how she delt with it. not a bunch of stories from different times.
__label__2 CHARGERS History is awesome!: My anticipation while waiting to get my copy was greatly satisfied after we watched the Chargers History DVD. We are huge Chargers fans and watching the DVD brought back some really great, old memories of the Chargers from my youth. Great videos, great pictures, great footage of the San Diego Super Chargers!!
__label__2 Needs a bit more editing and better formatting: The book told a pretty good story, but the enjoyment was lowered because of the odd formatting and some poor editing. Regarding the formatting, many times there was no break at all between different scenes, which sometimes was quite confusing. Also the editing could use some work. "Happily" is not spelled "haply" (that is a real word, but with an entirely different meaning, so it made it past spell-check; although the "slighdy" isn't a word it made it through as well). Also, someone lazy capitalized italicized the boat names. For the non-word named boats (like Rainbowe) that worked fine. But the person didn't bother to not capitalize and italicize the word "defiant" everywhere it was. So a person/action was described "Defiant" in italics several times.
__label__2 I feel like this video is the bet kept secret...: I remember being a kid and seeing these commercials for BUNS OF STEEL!!! So I decided to try it. I am average in size and I really don't need to lose any weight, but my backside could use some serious firming up. I've been doing lunges and squats which has helped some, but this video has given me better results after just 3 days! I've done this video three days in a row, and I can SEE my thighs and butt firming up. I swear the cellulite seems to be going away, and it has been there forever. The workout is hard though, your legs will be CRYING from pain the first time you do this. You might cry too...:) Just do as many reps as you can when you start, and try to keep up. I am looking forward to how good I will look after a month of this, there is no doubt I will look great because this video is intense toning. I like Greg...he's funny and keeps you motivated!
__label__1 Backstage Handbook: This product did help me slightly for my backstage, but not as much as i thought it would. I feel it could have helped more. I was told to get it for class, but we hardly used it. It was pointless buying the book. Wouldn't advise buying it
__label__1 Red letter---- boo: Any one needing large print doesn't need the difficulty of the red print if this had been pointed out, I would NOT have purchased it. The black print is good. Of course the meat of the new testament is in red. Not a very good color to see, especially for any one needing large print. I would NOT recommend this edition to anyone else. I am making do.
__label__2 My kids love this!: This is the game that goes in the car and to grandmas house and anywhere else there is time to consume. Learning how to play once the idea is understood, it is easy to play and master. Loads of fun battling each other! My 8 yr old can not wait to battle others! We have not had problems with its durability yet, it has been a week.
__label__2 B/D cordless hedge trimmer: Have purchased B/D cordless chain saw, hedge trimmer & weed eater and love all 3 items. Highly recommend them and had battery life to spare each time I used them. Great to eliminate need for gas and electric cords.
__label__2 What a great writer: THis was the first book I have read by this author. The story held my interest from beginning to end. It is fast-paced but thought provoking about a woman whose marriage was unraveling at age 51 and realized it when she woke up one morning and felt that something wasnt righy
__label__1 Color me one disappointed Ennis fan...: Not to get personal or anything, but I sincerely have to wonder about some of the people who thought that this was such a great book. I'm an Ennis fan--read all of Preacher and all of Ennis' collected Hellblazer work to date--and so I was especially disappointed at this dreadful bit of work, which reads like bad fan fiction written by someone who is trying to emulate Ennis but really can't write. In fact, I would be relieved (although still peeved about buying this book sight unseen without reading it first) if it turned out that it was ghosted by someone else and published under Ennis' name.
__label__1 A Haggadah for Christians: Being Jewish has fundamental aspects that are not open for questioning. We believe in ONE G-d. We believe the Mashiach has not arrived. We believe that G-d is indivisible. This Haggaday is a marvelous tool for people of the Christian faith who want to observe Pesach in a tradition that is appropriate for them. However, for a Jewish family this Haggadah holds no place. It references Jesus. It equates Matzot with the trinity and wine with Jesus' blood. Sadly Jewish families with limited knowledge of their religion may be actually persuaded to convert to these beliefs as they fall in line with the beliefs of the majority of Americans. As such books like this can be a danger. Be forewarned!
__label__2 Draw like a pro: Well, what can I say but Chris Hart has totally outdone his previous books! This book is an excellent source of information with art and tips from pros from company's such as Top Cow and Chaos comics. There is even a small section on coloring with a 2 page comic preview of Bad Kitty (Chaos) at the end. The best book on the market I have ever seen. I myself am a freelance comic book artist and I give this book a 5/5!
__label__2 Incredible. . .: I stumbled across these guys through Rod Stewart's version of "Rocks" during the VH1 Storytellers geriatric show. Rocks is the most incredible rock and roll song I have heard shince the earth was young. If you see a car bouncing up and down at the stop light it's me playing the PS version over and over and over. . .with Rod's. My problem? Now that I've found them, is this the album to buy to get me out of the gate with PS or is there another album with songs as incredible as Rocks? Enquiring minds want to know! "Get your rocks off!"
__label__2 Great set of glasses!: I have been using these for ~3 years now and I like these. Nothing extraordinary, but they do their job and look good doing it!
__label__2 Real sunburn relief: We discovered this stuff 15 years ago, shortly after we were married. Spent too much time out at the pool at a resort in Phoenix - in the summer. It's a gel product, and as soon as you apply it, you can feel the heat being sucked out of your skin. The healing properties of aloe vera without having to go chop up your plant.
__label__2 Commode completes humanure project: My wife & I needed a light-weight, portable commode with removable bucket in order disengage from the city sewer system, dumping our feces & urine into a backyard thermophilic compost pile. (We use sawdust & grass clippings to cover the deposit into the bucket after each use before taking the bucket out every three or four days; no unpleasant odor results with this method.) This product has been an inexpensive, suitable substitute for the toilet. (Why do each of us soil hundreds of gallons of purified water every month, flushing a valuable resource into the sewer system when millions of people across the planet have no access to potable water?) I replaced the smaller bucket accompanying the commode with a five-gallon bucket. Cleaning is easy with a garden hose.
__label__1 Do Not Waste Your Money: Yes........this cap is easier to put on the head as described, but move your neck and it starts slipping off. Additionally, it will not cover the entire hair area. I tried it in the pool and it does not come close to keeping your hair dry.......do not waste your money!
__label__1 Beware the Touch Screen Problem!: It turns out that this GPS has a well-known and significant problem with certain touch screens breaking loose from the electronics due to micro-fractures in the screen. The breakage renders the unit erratic at first and then completely freezes it up. You can google the many problems that people have had with it easily. When I called Garmin they ran through a few software fixes and then said I was out of luck since it was a hardware problem...without bothering to tell me that it is a well-known and frequent problem with the unit nor offering any kind of deal. A $300 unit, less than two years old, completely useless! Wow! Never expected that from Garmin!
__label__1 Unusable, cap not working: The device is unusable, the cap does not close properly and it leaks. I bought two of them, same on both. Looking for something else now.
__label__1 huh: I have always loved and trusted CorningWare, but these were so much smaller than advertised. I was trying to replace a 20+ year old pan that had gotten broken and was very dissapointed. Went to the store and bought a pan with the same stated measurements that was twice the size.
__label__2 THIS JUICER ROCKS!!: For a small juicer, the Breville Compact Juice Fountain packs a lot of power! It's amazingly fast and powerful plus easy to clean and dismantle and put back together. Also, the sexy design is hot so I don't mind leaving it out on the counter since I use it every day.
__label__2 Dry feet: I have extremely dry feet because I wear sandals all the time in the sunner, fall and spring. This product helps my feet (++++ mucho) if I use it two to three times a day.
__label__2 My first Pop-Up book: I became the shipment very quickly. The book is good for someone who never had make paper creations with pop-up techniques before.
__label__1 Not enough techniques given, too much storytelling: I was disappointed in this book. I expected to get specific cognitive behavioral techniques to change the way I react/talk when I am upset. Instead I got a bunch of stories about patients, and a bunch of stories about the author and her husband (which especially got old and are not helpful for those of us who are lonely and don't have that kind of love in our lives). Overall I didn't get too much from this book, I'm sad to say. I think I need more direct instruction rather than stories to try to illustrate things. It just wasn't for me.
__label__1 not a performance one could dream about: It is a very poor and boring interpretation: frequent fast tempos instead of grace and charm (for example, compare with "Concertos" by Camerata Bern or by Kuijken). It looks like a formal and cursory approach only to demonstrate the virtuosity of the players. In the note line it is said that the musicians mounted the winged Pegasus. It is a lie! they ride a wild mustang and gallop as if in a rodeo race. I am very disappointed. Any project intended to record a volumnious music in a short time (here we have the spring of 2004)is doomed to failure. The only plus is the complete music in one box set.
__label__2 A PALM CONVERT: I had a Palm 5 since they came out, and it was a GLORIFIED rolodex. Black and White screen uninspired software.And then it happened, my palm almost ruined me, as I wasnt using my palm because it was terrible and I figured a Pocket Pc was a Palm with a pretty color screen.WAS I WRONG. The pocket pc is INCREDIBLE. Where do I begin? The games are INSANE. Go to Handago.com and look around. Age of Empires looks like a shrunk version of the full one. The games are better and faster than a gameboy. NICE STUFF.I have two memory cards in this machine and I am estatic one 128 meg sd card is chock full of MP3's and the other 128 meg card is full of USEFUL SOFTWARE.The size of the unit is great, the screen is nice to look at.FOR THE PRICE this is a great unit.One complaint is the battery life could be better, but its not a problem.
__label__1 Scam...: The previous review is right on. The packaging and the wording on it is deceptive. Furthermore, both the package and their web page indicate that the software is enhanced with photos...there is not one photo or so much as an illustration on on the entire cd. In fact when you buy a cd you assume that there is approximately 700Mb of information on it. Fact is, this program and all of its "readme" and help files consists of just under 9Mb of data. If you should see this program at a flea market or garage sale for a quarter...save your quarter for a gumball machine where you get something for your money.
__label__1 A couple fell apart within hours of opening...SMALL PIECES: We bought these for our 3 yr old. I wasn't too thrilled when one of the little wheels came off soon after opening the package. Also a couple of the characters popped off their wheel base (super glue repaired both problems). Though since gluing them back together nothing else has come apart, I'm still cautious about them b/c my son still tends to put things in his mouth. Their really not worth the money. He hardly plays with them at all. He probably wouldn't even miss them if I took them.
__label__1 Not worth it: The DVD covers will not even fit in the sleeves provided. Realizing I'm tearing up my covers plus I can't see my DVDs in the thing, it wasn't worth using it. I find better ones at Walmart.
__label__1 Made in China?!?! WTH?!?!: Fortunately, I received this as a Christmas gift but was extremely disappointed at the Delta 'quality'. One simple example is the table casting which, is substandard, to say the least!! One side has a large casting blemish. I had to use a rat tail file to round finish rounding the slot ends and a bastard file on the edges to keep from getting cut. This is allegedly a 'DELTA'... a Company in Tennessee, right?!?! Wrong... this damn thing was manufactured in China and it truly shows. I realize many products are manufactured in China but fine woodworking machinery should not be one of them. Buy it if you want but for my money, I will look elsewhere... even if it means spending more.
__label__1 Jabra C820s active noise cancelling stereo headphones: These headphone are not very comfortable. They are also heavy which makes them uncomfortable to wear for a long period of time. The headphones seemed to not fit my ears. They did cancel the noise in the airplane. I also wish they would fold.
__label__2 REAL LIVE BLEEDING FINGERS: If CAR WHEELS was her "a heartbreaking work of staggering genius" & ESSENCE it's shy melancholic step-sister, WORLD WITHOUT TEARS offers the best of both.The opener captures the frustration & disappointment of coming to terms with one's work (creatively & otherwise). Paul Westerberg would slit his wrists to have written the likes of "Minneapolis". Fans of "Drunken Angel" can raise their lighters to the likes of "Real Live Bleeding Fingers..." Ranking up with past gems, "Like A Rose" & "Envy The Wind" is "Those Three Days". Purists should cut her some flack for pseudo-Rapped, "Sweet Side". It takes a bigoted mind indeed not to be touched by this song's message.At 50, she's just as vital, ragged, vulnerable & uncomprimising as ever. Though perhaps not destined to be the classic CAR WHEELS has become, it's still a very strong piece of work. Something you will come back to & far more rousing than most of ESSENCE.
__label__1 Not as labeled - incorrect diameter: Actually ZERO STARS! The label is WRONG! This is NOT 3/16". It IS 3/32"!!! This is totally useless for applications where I need REAL 3/16". I cannot understand how a fundamental specification can be so completely incorrect.
__label__2 Very excellent book!: Very good book if you don't know which beach resort to go to in Mexico. We knew we were going to Ixtapa but had never been to Mexico before. This book had the most comprehensive information on Ixtapa compared to others I looked at on the shelf. Written very lighthearted, honest and to the point. Good general information in the first couple of chapters about traveling into Mexico and what to expect (money, food, customs, culture, etc.). I found that the information was very acurate in its referrals in all areas (restaurants, lodging, places to go, night spots). I will keep this book to help me make a decision on which place to visit in Mexico next trip!
__label__1 Definitely wait for the paperback: I will let the others review the plot and I will tackle the lack of words. I would not recommend spending money on the hardbound version. The author had chapters that were one and two pages long which means that words were only printed on half of the pages. The format actually interrupted the flow of the story.Any English teacher would give back a paper submitted like this and would ask the 300 odd pages to be condensed to 200 pages.Don't spend extra money on the hardbound book.
__label__1 A bit misleading: I haven't yet read the book, but wanted to respond to the promo blurb that states that the instructors organization (AASI) says you will fall in a lesson. It does not. I am a AASI trained and certified snowboard instructor and can confirm that instructor training and certification programs all focus on empowering instructors to teach "slam free" snowboard lessons. It has been a very big focus in all of the instructor training programs I have participated in (after all, who wants to fall hard while on vacation?)I can understand the desire to position the book as a unique resource, but I'm afraid the publisher overstates the case (far overstates) that this approach is unique to the author. No-Fall methodologies are employed pretty much across the board in the USA.I do look forward to reading the book--but the overstatement does make me wary.
__label__2 The outstanding sequel comes to your home.: This sequel to jak and daxter the precursor legacy holds itself pretty well.With a massive city and exits to outside areas, it makes for a long but very intresting storyline.Immediately after the events of jak and daxter jak, daxter, and their friends are taken far into the future. Now they are in Haven City, the large metropolis that was built over sandover village.Their arrival does not go smoothly however. Jak is imprisoned and spends two years being tortured and experimented with the dreaded dark eco.Daxter meets up with jak and the two set to exact revenge on the people who tortured jak.Very good game, it has a fantastic storyline, huge environment, and it ties it all together with the gta-inspired freedom to go where you want to go when you want to.
__label__1 For the money...: For the money I would expect sturdier poles. The first time we used the canopy one of the connectors between the segments of the poles broke apart. We have jimmed it back together but the pole hasn't been the same. I don't have much faith in the canopy and only expect it to last 2 seasons at most. I would have returned the product after my first outing with it if the process wasn't such a pain in the butt. For the money of this one canopy I would suggest buying several cheapos, each of which would likely last just as long. Wish I would have bought a model with a vent in the top as well.
__label__2 Brutal Death Metal!: Nonexist is one hell of a band. The death metal scene will never be the same again. Johan Liiva, singer for Nonexist, is originally from Arch Enemy. He has a gut-wrenching voice that demands respect. Johna Reinholdz has some of the best guitar work i have ever seen in a death metal band. With one listen to Nonexist's new album, Deus Deceptor, you'll know that the new kings of death metal have arrived. If you like Nonexist, also check out bands like Kalmah, Destruction, and Hate Eternal.
__label__2 Great!: I love the laser. I always cut crooked, even with the guide lines. The laser ensures a perfect cut each time!
__label__1 There are Better: I love Exo Terra products, but this one just did not hit the mark for me. It has to adhesive to the tank and does not lay completely flat due to the plug. It also does not put off enough heat with a 1/2' thick sand substrate.
__label__2 Vols switchplate: I love this design! It would look super on a white wall. The T really stands out beautifully.
__label__2 entertaining: I have an old VHS copy of this film which I have watched over and over again and also have lent to others who really enjoyed it. I am glad I can add a DVD to the collection. Also have the soundtrack and the songs are great.
__label__2 Awesome Writer: Kate Green's Theresa Fortunato novels hold your interest and the pace is always quick. I wish she wrote more than three Fortunato novels.
__label__1 Ten Steps To Overachieving In Business: Rick Pitino's book on how to overachieve in the business world is nothing that anybody with any common sense hasn't heard before. The book was written because Pitino is trying to tell his story of his basketball career. He will make a germane point with the first paragraph at the beginning of the chapter, and then will belabor the simple point into 20 pages. This is a good book to read, buy you don't need to read the whole thing, you need to read the first few points of the chapter, where Pitino makes his point, and the summary of the main points at the end of the chapter, and you will learn just as much as somebody who read the whole book. It is a decent piece of literature, but combined with a biography of Pitino's career makes the entire work way to redundant.
__label__2 Great overall: The best book of its type on the market. The styles and yarn selection are flattering and contemporary and the size ranges are realistic. I want to knit almost everything in here. Some of the measuring and alteration instructions are a bit more complicated than necesssary, but still highly recommended.
__label__1 Interview with an Angel: I do not recommend this product. Though I'm not part of any organized religion (or other spiritual group), I still found many parts of this book to be highly offensive. Be skeptical of this book if you are looking for it as a source of spiritual guidance or even just general interest.
__label__1 Connecticut Yankees in Jurassic Park: This book takes the high-tech underground lab of "The Andromeda Strain," the constant threat of dismemberment of "Jurassic Park," and the ubiquitous robotic characters of "West World" and mixes them all together. The problem is that the robots are all supposed to be human!Despite the massive bibliography showing what appears to be a superhuman research effort, Crichton's inability to make a convincing human character or plot twist gives his feudal setting all the believability of an evening at the "Medieval Times" dinner theater.
__label__1 .026 string does not fit the nut on my ESP guiutar: I tune to C, and I usually play Ernie Ball power slinky strings (.011 - .048). I wanted to try a set of 12's. I put the strings on my ESP strat-style guitar. The .056had a very hard time getting through the tuning peg on the headstock. The .026 (3rd string, Eb in C standard, G in regular standard) does not fit in the string slot on the nut. I spent a few days adjusting the truss rod and intonation for these new strings, but they sure don't work well with this guitar. A buddy of mine uses them on his Jackson King V with a Licensed Floyd Rose double locking system and loves it.These would be good on a baritone guitar, but not on my guitar. Gonna try the Blue Steel strings (11 - 52) next. Might end up going back to the EBPS 11-48 set again.
__label__2 Great Passover Resource For Jews and Non-Jews: An integrated look at the Passover seder and celebration combining traditional Judaic thought with application to modern day believers. Easy to read and understand. A must buy if you wish to celebrate both Easter and Passover.
__label__2 Cooking for the storyteller: I am what you might call a fair-weather-cook. I only find myself heading to the kitchen when I am swept up by some romantic or ecstatic urge to create. Sundays at Moosewood is my one and only cookbook because it's the only one that whips up my creativity enough to drive me into the kitchen to make some magic. As a professional writer, I am inspired by the storytelling that accompanies the recipies. Often I find myself enjoying picturing the images that led up to the finding of the recipe as much as I am enjoying the food itself. p.s. meat-eaters will love it too!
__label__2 Excellent detail, but not very durable.: The first thing that really surprised me about this model was its size. This thing is huge-the wings barely fit through the hallway in my apartment. And of course the detail is very good: warning labels, rivet holes on the hull, the canopy even opens like the real thing. However, I agree with the other reviews completely about its durability. The accessories (fuel pods, bombs, and rockets) aren't as interchangeable as they're designed to be. Once you snap them into place, it's hard to take them off again. But what really gets me is the nose gear. Like some of the other buyers on this site, I broke it off trying to retract it. There are no instructions on how to do it the right way. The landing gear doors are flimsy also. This thing could use a little more metal.All in all, the P-38's a decent buy. As long as you're really careful with it, it's pretty awesome. Would love to see them come out with a P-47 and a B-26.
__label__1 Could have been shorter: This is a 400 page book that could have been 300. The reader has to wade through the descriptions to get to the plot. And that hopping back and forth from the past, when they were 19, to the present drives me nuts.
__label__1 skip it: This is just a poorly executed core body boot camp, nothing particularly "postnatal." The three ostensible fitness levels aren't different tracks of the disk but just two other women (one looking a lot like Olive Oyl) doing the same exercises as Lindsay Brin but not as well. None of them look like they could recently have had a baby. The lousy videography and awful camo outfits make this video difficult to even watch.
__label__2 Best Movie No One Has Ever Seen: I'm glad I'm one of the few who saw this movie when it was released. Incredible cast and performances. If you're a Paul Newman fan and haven't seen this movie, just go ahead and buy it now. Because it was a "small" picture, it is very difficult to find!
__label__1 It's NOT REAL Hungarian Paprika: If you look at the paprika, it's not REAL Hungarian. Thus, this is why it says Hungarian "style." Don't be fooled by sellers who sell you Spanish or Chinese paprika under the umbrella of "Hungarian Paprika." Also, they can't even spell "Kalocsai" right on the can! So much for their 'Hungarian style' of FAKE Hungarian paprika. I highly suggest to pass on this item!
__label__1 Difficult reading: I bought this book after a highly respected person in the options industry labelled it "one of the top 3 trading books of all time" - and I'd read the other two. I've given upon this one on p. 45, although I may pick it up and try again sometime. The content is difficult, but the writing makes it almost impenetrable -- and the charts don't compare with modern ones. So, even though there may well be lessons to learn from it, it requires a dedication of purpose that I just haven't been able to bring to the table.
__label__2 Wonderful scent!: I used to buy it at Whole Foods, but they stopped stocking it... Makes my house smell like a summer walk through the California hills.
__label__1 picture/audio worse than vhs!: Sacrifices had to be made in order to fit the Concert and Film profile all on a single disc.If you play this dvd, you will notice that the colors are nowhere near as vibrant as they were on the vhs.You will notice the reduced sound qualify if you turn it up. It sounds like the audio was compressed by a bad mp3 converter.It would have been better to simply make two dvds, and thus preserve the audio and picture quality, or even enhance them, as I did.I transfered my own purchased vhs copy to dvd, and set the converter to enhance the colors and sound. It might be hard to believe, but this vhs-to-dvd transfer surpasses the qualify of this professional dvd version.If you don't really care about picture/audio quality, it's a good purchase.
__label__1 World's most concise plot summary: Life didn't go how I planned. I got cancer. My career tanked. I had disappointments. Good people have bad things happen to them. Many religious people behave badly. Many formal religions are in conflict and therefore some of them are obviously wrong. Therefore there is no god. And by the way, I am smarter than the rest of you.There's a reason they call them "believers", not "know-ers". Anyone who gives an answer other than "I don't know" or "I believe there is" when asked about the existence of God is an arrogant fool. They didn't think there were germs 200 years ago. After all, there was no "proof".
__label__1 The old fashioned way works better: I have to agree with Mary A's review. For the life of me I can't seem to get this process right. The 4 oz bottles are either too hot or too cold and I have followed the instructions to a "T". And if the bottle is not warm enough and you try to reheat, you can't turn the system on again for a long, long time. When you have a crying baby in your arms, this just doesn't cut the mustard. I can't tell you how many times I've just resorted to running the bottle under warm water or just feeding the baby a slightly cold bottle (he'll eat anything!). I'm disappointed in this product and I'd recommend you don't waste your money on it.
__label__1 UNCLE MILTON SHAME ON YOU: THIS MOON TOY AND MOST OF UNCLE MILTONS TOYS ARE BATTERY DRAINING PRODUCTS,DONT HANG THIS TOY TO FAR UP IN ROOM BECUZE ONCE U TURN IT OFF FOR A DAY ALL SIX BATTERIES WILL BE 70 PERCENT DRAINED,EVEN WHEN U TURN OFF THE SWITCH,I BOUGHT 2 FOR ME AND ONE FOR A FRIEND,HERE IS AN EXAMPLE ON HOW UNCLE MILTON PRODUCTS ARE MADE,IF THEY MADE A CAR IT WOULD LOOK-FEEL,SOUND LIKE A CAR ,,,,BUT IT WOULD HAVE NO POWER STEERING,ONE HEAD LIGHT,AND GET 1/2 MILE TO THE GALLON.....JUNK COMPANY
__label__1 DONT BUY!!: Sure they look pretty in the picture- so pretty in fact that I ordered them- BIG MISTAKE!!!! They were so cheap looking and the glitter was like falling off- The colors are ugly and one of the butterflies was so poorly glued on that it wasnt attached to the mirror! The other one had so much glue it basically took up the small dinky mirror-Again i repeat dont buy! I was so disappointed!!
__label__2 Good for recovery: An art therapist suggested this book while I was hospitalized for depression. I am currently on week one and I cannot describe how much it helps. The daily activities in this workbook help those who lost their ability to do mundane task (wash dishes, cook, clean, launder) this book is gradually restoring my confidence that has been lost for several years. My mood and thinking shifted from blah to POW!I am also beginning to create material art once again and mold my life as a masterpiece of my own design. I love this book!
__label__2 Fun, Fun, Fun!: I can't get enough of these girls! Their antics are as funny as ever, but even more enjoyable is watching how the dynamics of their very different personalities work together to make them the best of friends. It's fun to watch these 4 singletons experience dating and single life in New York City. They are lively, fashionable, characters and watching them is nothing short of fun.
__label__1 Great Item, God Awful Price???: My little man loves these & I came here to Amazon to check into purchasing from them instead of where I have been. [...] I can't believe there are so many people here getting ripped off, do a little digging & you will find them much much cheaper!!! Try [...]................Your Welcome!
__label__2 AWESOME!: The box set is better than I expected, with one side picturing Sebastian and Ciel and the other side having Claude and Alois. The material of the box is also better than I expected and I am very happy with this product! So if you haven't watched the first season, I would advise you don't watch the second one just yet, but both seasons are so worth it!
__label__2 Schau, schau, der Peter mixed herum (in fact, pretty well): Ugh, "It's No Good" is a horrible track, even the remix can't rescue it. I thought overall the CD was an okay buy (especially if you already have Junior Vasquez Vol 2 ... get that first, if you don't have it already: two of the best tracks--by Size queen and Hans--overlap). Still, I loved the reworking of Falco's "Der Kommissar" into a club track (some of the vocals got thrown out) and "My Urban Soul".
__label__1 VIZIO 50" plasma tv is BAD: I bought ours from Sam's Club after a week of comparitive shopping, and wish I had not seen it. We had it three years when the power supply went out, and after a three month wait on the part and $458 in repairs, we only had it two more months before it went out again, this time some circuit boards with a repair cost of over $700 for parts alone. Gave up on it and bought a different brand.
__label__2 Not Complete: This is a must for all GB fans, but be prepared in case you have these concerts on VHS to be a little disapointed... Contrary to popular believe, these are not the complete concerts. There are MANY tracks missing out of the Central Park Concert, such as "Beaches of Chyeanne." The Complete concert can be found on the VHS version. I was highly disapointed when I found some of these great numbers were missing.Also missing are a lot of introduction to songs as well..
__label__1 Holler If You Hear Me: after reading this book, i have decided it was not good. only reason i finished it was because my interest in 2pac, i would not reccomend this book to anybody with all the other books available on 2pac. i could not stand the way it was written, the author is horrible. he writes the book as if he has somethin to prove of his vocabulary, blurting words that can be substituted for more common words. however, he did have good references in the book. the only reason i give this book 2 stars is because i appreciate anything about 2pac.
__label__2 doctor recommended it and it's great: no fragrance, not greasy, just soothing and doesn't make me itch later on like so many lotions. I ordered it for my Grandma and she loves it too. She became allergic to her regular lotion.
__label__2 It could be better......: It's worth having as it is but it's not the classic that it might have been. A hardcover edition with the prayers in Hebrew with transliteration, as well as the fine English translation contained in this book, would have been made this book a classic. To my knowledge the book I describe does not exist but it should. We need it! Publishers take note!
__label__2 ABSOLUTELY THE BEST: MUSIC IS AMAZING, THE VARIETY AND QUALITY OF PERFORMERS IS THE BEST AND IT'S A GREAT GIFT.
__label__1 Med Tech CLS Review: This book shows the basics of the subjects involved. However, it receives 2 stars because of so many mis-spelled words, blocks of text inserted into the wrong places, and simply wrong answers in numerous places.
__label__1 What a great keyboard (NOT)!: I bought this keyboard to control Windows Media Center primarily. I have a large projection theater setup that places me about 30ft from the computer and despite being on the edge of its range, it worked great - for about a year. Out of the blue the other day the mouse no longer worked and only SOME of the keys (it's like the FN key was stuck on). I've read where others have had this exact problem. It's almost like, after time, something inside burns out and you're left with a crippled keyboard and NO mouse. I've since recieved a different brand kayboard, but it has issues as well. Why can't someone simply make an RF keyboard that works?Anyway - BEWARE, there are other keyboards with different brand names that are actually this same keyboard - so watch for this design and avoid it.
__label__2 So far, so good.: We bought this to get a blender and to replace a leaky (and piece of junk) Hamilton Beach food processor. We live in a cramped apartment, so anything that saves us space by condensing or being multi-functional is highly attractive. I've already broken the blender carafe. The replacement is only $20, but note that the plastic ring at the bottom is an extra $5! It's removeable, I had no idea. Both machines have worked well, and we've had no complaints. We like to make smoothies, and this has been great at crushing ice. I've only used the food processor a couple times. I'm kind of illerate with food processors, and find hand-chopping to be relaxing.
__label__2 Love this whole collection!: If you are into adult coloring books..you will love this one and all of the cultural ones...I bought this one, one from india and one from japan and ALL Of them are fun to do and have beautiful designs..they would make excellent gifts...my nieces LOVE them!
__label__2 A Definite Page Turner!: This was an excellent story about World War II. Three friends who share quality time at Sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the War. Harry Waever is in military intelligence for the United States. His other two friends,Jack Halder and Rachel Stern are at work for the Nazis. They are setting up a German plan to assasinate Roosevelt and Churchill in Egypt. It is up to Weaver to stop them. They are of course reunited. This excellent book has many surprises as well as manytwists and turns. The book will definitely leave you wondering what if? Be sure to read this book, you will not be dissapointed.
__label__2 Good video, Great Gift for new Parents: This video is an excellant video for new Moms and Dads, and in addition for anyone who will be helping with the newborn, to give Mom and Dad a break. The only drawback I found with the video was the length of the video. I wished it had gone into more detail , most specifically caring for the crying baby, and also, care of the baby up to 6 months. However, I can find no fault in this being a beginners tool for learning, and also, a refresher for us who have not taken care of an infant in many years. I purchased this video for first time parents. I wanted to watch it before giving it to make sure it would be something I would be glad to give as a present. I am glad and the parents were very happy to receive. See visually is great because reading is good but for those who are visual people, the instructions from this video will be more helpful. A great gift idea.
__label__1 Horrible: I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens, and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking, smoking, engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism, having sex with girls between the age of 12 and 15, and stealing from their parents.This was a huge waste of an hour and a half. I only gave this movie 1 star because amazon doesn't allow me to give it 0.If you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens, and is GOOD, Thirteen is the movie you wanna watch.
__label__2 Copy-cat: Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land, people, and dragons. Although, he needs to learn to be more original. I can see getting your inspiration from a book (The Lord of the Rings) but this is just taking it too far. Paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own!Eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive. Some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters. The story has an okay plot line and I am eager to see where it takes Eragon. But advice for Paolini on future books, use your imagination and do something original! It's easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new.
__label__2 A moving call to re-examine the Bible: When I ordered this book, I expected it to be a defense of the Protestant position of Sola Scriptura, but to my surprise it is instead aimed at correcting liberal Christian views of how we form relationships with God. The book opens with a story of a Christian woman who was waiting for God to tell her directly that she should make amends with her estranged parents, when a friend told her to open her Bible to Exodus 20:12 and read.The book proceeds in this direction emploring the reader to use his or her Bible as a means to form a personal relationship with God rather than expecting God to speak by direct revelation. It also briefly defends the authority of the Bible against such attacks as higher criticism and the Jesus Seminar.Despite the "Why" in the title, I would have to say that it is more pastoral than apologetic. Even so, I recommend it.
__label__1 A Choppily Abridged Carol: Although the artwork in this book is great, readers should be warned that the text is a heavy-handed abridgement of Charles Dickens's wonderful little novel. It omits far too much of the rich and colorful language of this stirring novelette.
__label__2 Excellent classic: It was great to read this classic once again. Read it years ago and forgot how great especially around the holidays
__label__1 Not Useful as a Walker for all Children: My child could not use this as a walker. The protruding arms that are used later on for them to ride did not give her enough room to walk in between them. I took it back.
__label__2 ProKeys 88SX - the real deal: This keyboard is a great little keyboard, 7 solid sounds, minimum frills, great price and easy to transport. I use it mainly for recording. It is not really what I would call a road-worthy board, but in a static set-up, it's perfect for me.
__label__2 Somewhat helpful.: This was somewhat helpful in my study of vintage clothing. It is not as helpful for my needs as The Dictionary of Costume and Fashion.
__label__1 Don't waste your time: Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I think the author may have been going for a satire of the Scarlet Pimpernel story, but this book is dreadful. Clichéd characters, people who speak and act like 21st century characters in a 19th century setting. Laughable dialogue, a contrived storyline, from start to finish there is nothing to recommend the book.I thought I was getting a good historical fiction, what I got was a bad romance book and most unbelievable of all to me is that this appears to be the first of a series.With all the wonderful writers out there, the fact that this book was even published is astounding.
__label__1 stand alone doesn't work: I was mistaken. I bought and installed Office Student Home edition on my 2 new Windows 7 computers. I decided I would still like Outlook for e-mail so I spent the money and bought this software. Well guess what. Since it was not purchased in a bundle, some of the features aren't functional. You can't use themes or stationery. Word will not be the text editor for e-mail. Spell check will not work without connectivity to Word. I am sure there are other missing features I haven't discovered yet. Microsoft knows all about this yet they did not make it plain enough for me. I am very frustrated with MS for this shoddy system. I bought 3 new computers for home and church in the last 2 months. If I knew how, I would rip Office out of all of them and send it back but what can I do now? BE WARNED. Oh for the old days when Office came with everything.Randy Rusconi
__label__1 Disgusting and Depressing: I along with many others read Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood first. I LOVED it!!! It was one of those books I didn't want to end! I was elated when I found Little Altars everywhere at my local thrift store. I can't believe the diffence between the two!I was caught off guard immediatley with the lesbian chapter. I had no idea that's where R. Wells was taking it. I had to read and re-read where the mother molests Little Shep because I was sure I was taking it the wrong way. I felt sympathy for Vivi in DSYYS, but not after this. If you want my opinion, read Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood and forget about Little Altars Everywhere. It's trash, plain and simple!
__label__2 Outstanding: The webcam is an easy to operate, fully functional device. Perfect for laptops. The Range on it could be a little better. The mic is excellent.
__label__2 One among two: If I only had two books to live by it would be the Bible and the Guide to Rational Living.I have read and re-read. This book I have used faithfully since the early 60's and it is more revealing today than ever.
__label__2 I recommend it - get Amazon to send it!: I was delighted to find this book. Rather than quoting Nash's verse at length, Parker uses quotes quite judiciously to illustrate various points he's making. This made me want to read more of Nash's collections, which I feel is an indicator of a good biography.I thought the book was well-paced and engaging. I'm not a big fan of biographies (I tend to find them overwrought and melodramatic), but enjoyed this quite a bit.
__label__2 Thank you: I love this series. I was very disappointed when it did not continue after the third season. This is great
__label__1 Really bad: I agree with most of the other people that posted. This game is a straight run and gun game with no planing or strategy. Hell most of the time your team seems to be there to serve as another target for your enemy. The AI sucks badly most "breach bang and clear" strategies seem to fail most of the time. Also you only get one squad instead of 3, no mission planning and the weapon selections blows. They probably took out the mission planning since they want the game to be a run gun style game. I would probably given this game a higher score if they named it something other than R6 for the reason when I think of a Tom Clancy game I think of strategy, Teamwork and patience ,you don't need any of that here. Don't get me wrong its a mediocre game at best but doesn't deserve the R6 title.
__label__2 Cats Eye Stud Earrings: Product looks exactly as represented, except they were a little larger than expected. Very pretty though. Arrived quickly, too.
__label__1 poor quality: The feet fell off the cutting board within days. Despite religious applications on conditioning oil, the board began splintering almost immediately. I do not recommend this product.
__label__1 Mild: I loved the first two, but this one is just not very funny. I'm sorry, but Goldmember disgusted me, and his antics were not at all amusing. You never hear anyone on the street saying "Haha look at me I eat my own skin and have balls made of gold!" Plus his accent was non-descript. It's not like fat bastard where people actually liked him.Beyonce is a horrible actress. I rather like her music, but she simply has no talent when it comes to acting like something she's not (a 70's swingin roller girl or whatever she was supposed to be).most of the jokes were reused from the first two movies, and simply not as funny or shocking as they were before.i'd love to see an austin powers 4, but mr meyers please find some new jokes, and vixens that [aren't bad] at acting.
__label__2 A book that will grab you in the first few pages: The story of two, young and very accomplished violinists from two very different backgrounds. They meet in a music school in pre-war Vienna. As they mature, something sinister develops in one as it does in the country itself. The story begins with the auction (many years later) of a violin which was owned by one of them. The author tells his story around this violin which in the end reveals the connection between the two violinists. I found it a great Sunday afternoon read, next to a fire.
__label__1 My two cents - it's worth little more: Like its newer cousin which I unfortunately ordered at the same time - I found this book boring. Too many of the questions were really easy - and it wasn't because I'm too smart for the book. When you check the answers, quite a few of them indicate that 80%-100% of Mensans got the questions correct. On top of that nearly half the book is devoted to trivia and vocabulary. With these you either know the answer or you don't - there's no intelligence involved - only familiarity.I assumed this book would entertain me for a day. I hoped it would entertain me for a weekend. Instead it bored me for a little over an hour as I took the quizzes. If you're looking for tests of logic, reasoning, and mathematics skills then this book will be of minimal interest to you.
__label__2 Read it because we are living it...: In these times it's important to know that we do have a voice and we can make a difference. Atlas is a wonderful story about the world coming to a standstill because those looking for a handout pushed those who produced just a bit too far. Look around, it's exactly what is happening today. A government that promotes wealth redistribution and a compliant media were alive and well in Rand's novel published more than 50 years ago and lo and behold they are here today. Wonderfully written and eerily prescient it is even more important today than ever.
__label__1 Short Life Span: It's adorable and works great! I used it mostly at night when I sleep. However, the motor will die within a year. So only buy it, if you don't mind spending the money to replace it every year.
__label__1 A sign of Slayer developing their style...: ...but sometimes you must reach bottom to get to the top. I know, I know, they must have been on a budget, but I'm sure they could've found a decent quality studio at a cheap price. After all they lived in California, probably the epicenter of music (especially metal) in the 1980s.Many of these songs have potential, especially the song "Hell Awaits," which sounds like a firestorm live, but not only does the bad sound quality kill it, Slayer sounds like that they didn't even try to give their demonic brand of metal any justice while recording. The guitar sounds like it's being played on low volume through a dryer, and Tom Araya's vocals sound like he's talking through a dying a cell phone. ...
__label__1 Not worth the money: Worst baby product I purchased, I should have just purchased a portable cd player. This product constantly eats batteries, it skips and the volume low. I would not recommend purchasing this product.
__label__2 Pure Amazement: Though i usually like punk music, i gave this cd a try. I havent listened to the whole thing yet, but i would buy it anywasy. Thes songs are beautiful, and have some of the best piano work of all time. The songs are clean, pure, catchy, and inspiring. After listening to it, you wonder why Cold play isnt as popular as some other artists. Like a good dream, this cd is a breath of fresh air.
__label__1 Unsafe for Pets - FDA Inspection Failure!: FDA inspection Failed so the manufacturer was forced to stop production. It's not safe to feed to your pets. I ordered the same thing, just different shape - soft chews instead - but was only informed after the sale why it was discontinued.
__label__2 Super Reader: In the middle of the raging, multi-front conflict, Oz realises, as a half-wolf, he smells Angel. Buffy and her old friends head there to find out what is going on, and find a trap, and Camazotz.The rest of the Council teams are head pressed, even using the young Slayer Anna and Wesley as relief troops, and Buffy must face Giles alone so the others can go back and try and save some of their people.After this, Buffy and Willow realise Buffy needs to go back to her own time to the right moment where she makes the fatal mistake and allows this future to happen.Working this out, with the help of Lucy Hanover, she comes back, but again a desperate battle when her, the Scoobies and Camazotz and his Kakchiquel must be fought at the harbour.
__label__2 How to really love your child: Of course I thought I really loved my child before I got this book but I have to admit that I wasn't getting the message through to her. Now I understand that I need to really take more time to communicate with her, listen to her point of view and give her my undivided attention. I think Campbell's message is worth putting into practice. I highly recommend this book for any parent.
__label__1 Order Never Sent: It has been well over 30 days and nothing. Left message for seller, no response at all!Amazon is now handling problem and has contacted me w/ an apology and notice of no charge to my credit card.Very bad business practice to not communicate to buyer.
__label__1 Those Wigs!!!: I have seen 2 other versions of Wuthering Heights and of course read the Emily Bronte books in H.S. This version is not good at all. Those wigs worn by Ralph Fiennes and others distracted me for they were so bad. I cannot watch Ralph Fiennes most of the time and here he is not believable. Give me Sir Lawrence Olivier anytime. Sir Lawrence, though he did not get along with Merle Oberon during the filming, showed so much passion in the B/W version and even Timothy Dalton was tolerable. Juliette Binoche was boring and silly and my darling Jeremy Northam was hardly visable.
__label__1 Worst sheets ever: I bought the king-size sheet set from Amazon. They are the worst sheets I ever bought. First, they came full of wrinkles and with many loose threads hanging off. Second, there was a burn mark in the flat sheet so it probably wasn't new. Third, the sheets look cheap. I returned it.
__label__1 if you look for something similar to UK don't buy it: Maybe it's good but if you look for something similar to UK don't buy it, you will be disapointed.It's purely electronic instrumental music. He plays here solely on Synclavier Music Computer (whatever it is) - not a bit of this magic electric violin which I so much love on "Danger Money".
__label__1 Gibberish: This book is poorly organized, lacking critical information, and above all, confusing as hell. Concepts are scattered all over the place, like eggs thrown against a window. The actual writing is practically unreadable; the author seems to shift in and out of consciousness at the keyboard, leaving behind some sort of babble that resembles the concepts that should be embodied in this text. I'm really quite unsure of either how this got published, or how these guys became professors.
__label__2 Let's talk Menace: Here is a roundup of songs from one the best bands,to exist in the original punk era. The band released classic songs on Small Wonder records in 77. These songs can be found on this compact disc. The band had a smooth sound mixed with clear precise vocals.The only thing negative about this cd is that it only has eleven songs. Some live tracks added to the cd would have landed this release an instant five stars.
__label__2 Will Win Over Some Fence-Sitters: I've never been a huge fan of The Shins. Sure I liked some of their singles like most people, but there was something cheesy about them that prevented me from really diving into their aural world.With the release of "Wincing the Night Away," all this has changed. Their sound seems to have matured and become more complete and at the same time, darker. Armed with sharper teeth and a more carefree exploration of the sonic landscape, I believe The Shins finally have a killer album on the platter.Obviously the best album out this year and definitely one of my favorites of the last year.
__label__2 Unexpected Fun With Straw Hat Luffy: There are a ton of anime titles out there with more being released on DVD every day. I watched this movie from the One Piece series without ever having watched or even hearing of One Piece. I didn't know any of the characters, but they were fleshed out enough that I liked them from the start. It wasn't hard to figure out what was going on in the movie. I didn't need to know a ton of back story for it to make sense. If this movie was made to get new viewers interested in the One Piece series, then they did a good job. As soon as I finished watching it, I added the first DVD from the series to the top of my rental queue. I was surprised how much I liked it. All the characters in Luffy's band of pirates were cool making me want to know more about them. The movie had a sense of humor, some goofiness, and a lot of fighting.Note: The movie was pretty violent. I wouldn't recommend it for viewers under age 13.
__label__1 Durabrand DVD players are JUNK!: We bought two of these. Worked fine for 3 months and then battery's went bad. There are no replacement battery's obtainable per customer service. These things are spin offs of "EMERSON" products. You've probably seen them in stores. Emerson is the bottom of the food chain in electronics. Save your money, invest in a brand name. Don't buy one of these to be thrown out and your kids disappointed in only a few months. And Oh yes, lets go back to customer service for a minute. Try emailing customer service with the email given in the owners manual. It comes back as "No such address". Phone number.......... "the toll free number you dialed is disconnected..... no further number is available"....... RIP OFF!
__label__2 " All Star " THIS song is the freakin coolest: This CD is so cool, I luv it like crazy and it sure does Kick @$$. So i reccomend you that you go out and get this cd, luv the group lots !!!
__label__1 End the SERIES!!!!: After Narc. in Chains I was reluctant to buy another Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Book, but figured I'd give LKH the benefit of having at least 1 bad book. I should have stayed with my instincts and left this book on the shelf, I was happy to give my copy away to get it out of my sight.Put Anita Blake out of her misery, the series is dragging on with no end in sight and no plot or character development worth reading.The introduction of new characters has not been well thought out, new the characters are not very well written or very interesting.LKH's Publisher should put a stake through the next novel and kill the series.
__label__1 HP Laserjet 6L: My refurbished printer did not work when it came out of the shipping package. The error light stayed on and I could not get the printer to recognize that paper was in the bin and ready to go. The seller was nice enough to troubleshoot the problem with me, but I had to ship it back. Hopefully I will get a refund because I don't think the printer can be fixed. In addition, when I looked on line regarding this printer, I found another major problem--the printer tends to pull several sheets of paper at a time from the paper bin which has been a major complaint from other customers on various websites.
__label__1 Unreliable and short lived.: I have purchased 2 mosquito magnets that have both stopped working in their second season. These machines are too expensive to be this flimsy. Customer service is argumentative, and rude. A one year warranty is not acceptable for this price.
__label__1 This Rear Window needs to be tossed out the rear window!!: I always loved Jimmy Steward, and Grace Kelly was a princess of an actress, but it was Hitchcock who made any of his movies the superb classics they became. Please, please re-release the original, and I will be first in line to buy it.
__label__2 Amazing!: I loved this book so much. I have read it about twelve times and still find the same drama as realistic and hilarious as the first time I read it. Some of the drama is probably very unrealistic, but it still adds up to be a great book. Written in I.M.s this book is about 10th grade high school for any average high school student. The three main characters, Maddie (madmaddie), Zo (zoegirl) and Angela (snowangel), get in the midst of high school drama. Maddie gets in trouble at a party and it's around the whole school in ten minutes, and it almost ruins her reputation. Good girl Zo gets on with their high school English teacher. And Angela gets stalkerish boy trouble from a guy who won't leave her alone. I recommend this book to any middle or high school girl looking to step out of her drama and into another's.
__label__1 Jumperoo not a good change: My son is 9 months old and loved his exersaucer. So I thought that he needed to change his senery and would love to jump. I sold his wonderful exersaucer (bad mistake) and bought this online. Shipping was fast and very easy to put together. I put him in it and it was nothing but screams! So I try day after day and still he hates it. My hubby says that it is because he is too old to get used to something new. I hate that, beacause overall I thought that it was neat.Just a thought! Wish we could could return it, but threw away the box.
__label__2 highly enjoyable but too chomskyan: pinker is one of the most fun-to-read popular science authors currently on the scene (how the mind works and words and rules are also enjoyable, tho w&r less so than either lg instinct or htmw). therefore, his book is a good place to start for the person interested in language and linguistics but with little or no background.for those with little background, tho, some of the going may get a bit rough, as pinker goes fairly deep into one particular theory of language, closely related to the ideas of pinker's MIT colleague noam chomsky. while i respect both pinker and chomsky, i find both of them to pay far too little attention to how languages change over time and to how 'exotic' languages like navajo, finnish, and ingush work.chapter 12 provides a pretty good (tho occasionally angry) antidote to people who insist on answering 'can i go to the bathroom?' with 'i don't if you can, but you may'.
__label__1 no noticeable impact.: We have a very noise phobic dog and a "normal" dog that only gets worried for very severe thunder and close fireworks. the phobic dog is scared of the trash truck, barely audible fireworks in the distance, highway noise, you name it he's worried about it at some point. I didn't expect this to make him brave, but it doesn't even noticeably take off the edge in any concentration. it doesn't help the normal dog either, but the things she's scared of are so big and so loud that I imagine a full tranquilizer would be the only thing that helped. I'm not sure it's reasonable to expect a difference with fireworks the next house over, but we hoped it would ease mr scardey pants off his worry about the trash truck.
__label__1 Not powerful: We are returning the game. We followed the directions but themotor is not powerful enough to blow the butterflies out of the trunk. Some of the butterflies did not come out.
__label__2 Hogans Heros Kommadant Collection: When I received the Collection it was wrapped appropriately and looked good. The content was outstanding. The only drawback was how the discs were packaged. Each season looked like book but the actual discs were put in cardbord slots, which appear cheap but all in all the content made up for the was it was packaged. Great series with a presence we don't see on television today.
__label__2 Awesome: Holds the gels tightly, just be sure to get them in all the way. It is a bit difficult to do that initially but it's easy to pull them out to use. Light weight, colorful.
__label__1 Eh...OK but made son frustrated: The phone string was too short. This is due to the choking hazard but my son still got angry because the only way you could "use" the phone was to hold it in front of him.Most of the sides were difficult to play with because they were too small. The beads on top were hard to manuver because it was such a tight space.
__label__2 Good Overview of Their Later Work: If you're looking for the big hits, look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you want a servicable sampling of the bands post-1970 career, this will do fine. The band went through trials (literally) and tribulations duriing this time, and it shows in the stylistic inconsistencies. The band had an experiment phase, which more or less ended when "Endless Summer" created a huge demand for classic, sixties BB's music. They took the show on the road, and started trying to duplicate their old sound. You'll probably consider the later stuff a pale imitation of the BB's records you grew up with as a kid. Still better than most of what's out there.
__label__2 a love for great new music: I received the latest Garbage cd for my birthday titled Beautiful Garbage.. I have listened to it over and over again. This cd just mixes a lot of different beats in each song. I felt each song also has a different feel, meaning to it. My moods would go well with certain songs.... Shirley definitely did a good job on this album. I like their different styles on this album. She just overall has a good voice, but garbage is definitely something you would want to have. A must.. because it's so unique and just great...
__label__2 Both good!: I enjoyed both the US and Japanese movies! Both are scary films!I've seen all four of the Japanese movies, Ring1,2,0 and Ring Spiral. I do believe that the Japanese version is best seen in context with the sequels. Together they create a complete view of the sad story of Sadako. Sadako is a much more sympathetic character than is Samara. She, herself, is a victim of some unspeakable evil!The US Ring's ghost is just plain 'EVIL'. I have no sympathy for Samara. She scares the "living daylights" out of me. I probably would have thrown in the well, also.There are deleted scenes in the US film which I wish were left in the movie. They provide some important background to the plot.But, I'll keep both and scare myself on a regular basis. :)The original Haunting and the Lady in White still are at the top of my list of ghostly horror movies. But, these are not far behind.
__label__1 Disappointed listener: I'm disappointed by this album. The singing is just so bad. I have no interest listening to a singer struggling through his music. Too bad for a full price cd. I hope those record firms can introduce some quality control into their productions. Such substandard products are not fit for consumption!
__label__2 Love it love it love it!: Basil Rathbone is at his best in this movie as a villain. Great addition to any classic movie buff's library!
__label__2 Excellent Cookbook: I own almost 500 cookbooks, and this book is by far my favorite. Usually, when I try cookbooks, where is always good, fair, and awful recipes, but not this book. Every recipe I tryed was either excellent or very good. I highly recommend this book. Also good for beginner cooks.
__label__1 Good for 1 year old: I purchased this for my grand daughter. What a waste of money. I will be returning it today. You have to be about 10 feet from the other person and aiming it at them while they hold the other messenger. She will stick to her walkie talkies. We were all very disappointed in this product !
__label__2 Excellent Series: We started late on this series so we are using Amazon Instant video to catch up. Streaming is great, HD works well. No complaints. Highly recommend watching episodes that you may have missed or would just like to revisit.
__label__2 Amazing - great to see it back in print: I have always liked this book, with its vast international canvas and 'fin de siecle' feel. It was the only one HS Bhabra published under his own name, but fans may like to try the thrillers he wrote as A M KABAL too.
__label__1 Disappointing: In the Author's note it says "I decided to accept no direct advice or instruction from anyone",and it shows.The military tactics are flawed with what feels like lazy writing, not the standard of the earlier books.Will someone explain why Falklanders would collaborate with Argentinians, the Royal Navy sail to certain defeat and the Prime Minister be such a complete waste of time (ok that bit was funny, but...).Will someone tell Patrick Robinson that a Super Cobra is NOT a troop carrying helicopter - a mistake he seems to make repeatedly in all his recent novels.The strength of a techno-thriller is that it should be based in reality, this isn't and the basic errors stood out.Whilst I appreciate this has more than a little justifiable poke at the state of the UK's armed forces, and that Patrick Robinson writes US SEAL & submarine fan books, a little more balanced reality would be nice.Not sure I'll buy his next book based on this one.
__label__2 Worth Buying: Though not without a sense of whimsy, This book (like all of Judith Merkle Riley's books) deals with a strong and interesting female lead character and tells her story well. The story is propelled partly by the political machinations so common to the time -- so if you simply cannot deal with politics, do not read this book. The politics are portrayed in saucy enough manner that I doubt anybody could find them dry or boring, and Ms. Riley lays them out in a clear manner. The interactions of a frence demoiselle, her eccentric aunt, Nostradamus, a war, a demon, and various assorted roaylty and sycophants combine in a very amusing and interesting manner.
__label__1 Stopped brewing correctly in 3 weeks: Will NEVER buy another. This machine stopped brewing correctly after 3 weeks, it t0ok longer and longer to brew even after repeated cleaning.
__label__1 Video Production Handbook - Review: Good book but the material is somewhat "old" - no longer cutting edge in my personal opinion. I would have purchased a different book given another choice.
__label__2 Perfect transaction, fast shipping. Thank you.: Could not have asked for a better transaction. Item exactly as described and fast shipping. Thanks
__label__2 Cannibal, the Musical: This movie has got to be the funniest most original musical I have ever seen. It is silly, funny, and the songs will leave impressions in your mind long after the movie ends. I have re-rented this movie three times which is more than I can say for any other movie I have ever seen except one.
__label__1 Does not retain heat.: I use therapeutic heat nightly. After having this for two weeks I got a different one. This product does not stay warm long enough to be any real help!
__label__1 Problem after problem: I purchased this printer at a local BJ's wholesale store. The instructions were clear and easy to read, so set up was a cinch. I immediately began printing wirelessly from my PC and from a memory card inserted directly into the printer. The quality was great and I was impressed with the machine.That is until I tried scanning or copying, which came out pitch black. After a long time on the phone with HP's support, I was told something was wrong with the mirrors and we could get a refurbished one sent to me. I declined and went back to BJ's and got a new one. I set that one up and discovered that the small color display didn't work on this one. I called HP again and they were unable to fix it and offered the same refurbished deal. Two brand new printers fresh out of the box that are both defective are too much for me. See you later, HP!
__label__1 sizing issues: adult 2x is supposed to be a pretty big garment I thought but this 2x is about a medium or a tight large; definitely not a 2x. besides that nice for the price.
__label__2 Works great: What can you say? Well worth the price. My little girl got a hand-me-down DS Lite and we needed a charger for it. This one works with no problems.
__label__1 Cheap: This is really cheaply made; I didn't expect very much for the price, but it was far less than expected.
__label__2 dehydrating peppers and roma tomatoes: I dehydrated 2 1/2 gal of habenero peppers and @ 30 roma tomatoes. It did a wonderful job and I let it run for 3 days. I then ground up the habenero peppers in the food processer and put it into a pepper shaker. It is awesomely hot. It did a great job.
__label__2 Great Emergency Tool!: Having just survived Hurricane Sandy without a radio, as soon as I had power I got this excellent machine. The antenna stretches very long bringing in far away reception. This is a MUST for any and everyone. Remember, iPhones and the internet need power. Plus, wifi and 4G goes down when something bad hits. This works no matter what and has excellent battery life. And the price is unbeatable!
__label__2 Best album of ATOMIC KITTEN: I gotta say that this is probabaly the B~E~S~T album of Atomic Kitten!! ALL songs in this album are amazing!! My favourite song is "Nothing In The World" and "Ladies Night". Believe me, i listen to loads of British music, and you WON'T regret buying this album! IT'S ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!! LOVES IT!
__label__2 the calling of Emily Evans: Good Christian fiction. Realistic view of the struggles faced by ministers, especially women, getting started in remote areas. I would recommend.
__label__2 Great Starter: This is a great starter bike for anyone who wants to get into cycling. Please do research prior to buying to make sure this model will fit you. I am 5'10" with a 30 inch inseam and this bike fits me perfectly. Great little bike that is lightweight.ProsAffordableLight weightSleekGreat starter BikeConsThe tires should be checked and pumped before each ride, i have lost as much as 30psi in one week. (think about purchasing a plug in pump to go with it that can pump to at least 125 psi)If you are not familiar with putting bikes together you should find a local bike mechanic to put it together.
__label__1 Package Specs Are Incorrect. It is Letterboxed: In this day and age, why any studio would release a letterboxed version of a film on DVD, instead of an Anamorphic one is beyond me. The original Amazon specs indicated, as does the actual DVD package that it is enhanced for widescreen tvs, which isn't the case. When you pop in the DVD, the little tiny letterboxed version will be right smack in the middle of your 16X9 television. You will need to zoom in to fill your screen--or just chuck the DVD in the garbage out of pure frustration as I did.
__label__2 Great cotton . . . kinda snug: Great fabric. Enhances the butt, all the while not sneaking up there. I have large breasts and it's a bit snug in the chest area. The kind of snug that squashes them, not showing off the fullness.Over all A
__label__2 He did it again! This time in English.: Ricky Martin's English debut CD is great. A fresh and different sound. My favorite is "She's all I had." Great song in both English or Spanish. The duet with Maddona is screaming for a remix. I bet it happens soon...
__label__2 Cheap pads, works great!: Best pads ive ever used, very cheap and works greeeeaaaat, good absortion but not excellent....still an amazing product. Must have for couples with child 5 moths up.
__label__2 Indiana Jones & The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull: Harrison Ford is showing his age. He is still pretty good with the action in the films he makes, but this one is not up to the standard of the first one or the first two Indiana Jones Films. The Indiana Jones films need to stop here. No more! Let us watch what we already have and enjoy what we already have.
__label__2 Wonderful Collection: This is the most wonderful collection that I have seen in a long time. It has all my favorite mussicals in one set and they look and sound better than I could have imagined. I love it and would advise anyone to get it for your library. Every child should see these great films at least once.
__label__2 Perfect: Everybody quit whining about the instructions. Throw them away and follow Chovy's steps. I was up and running in 15 minutes. I'm posting this review from a back bedroom that previously had no wireless.
__label__2 GREAT Band and GREAT song: This song is absolutely beautiful. Both recordings. One will get you rocking and up on your feet dancing and the other will leave you awestruck.
__label__1 Sissy Azz Girl: Who would buy some (...)from some clown who will have only 1 number one hit,this album is for little 9 year old brats and(...) who can't get men.The only true hit he'll ever have is (...)Run It which is overplayed
__label__1 Not worth it: Thought I'd try these out so I could save some money (by not having to buy dryer sheets) and do my part for the environment (not throwing out all the dryer sheets). However, I don't think these help reduce drying time, they seem to always be stuck in a sleeve or somewhere. And they do NOTHING for static cling, which in the winter is a real problem. So I end up using dryer sheets for most loads anyway. The only load they seem to work for is towels, as there isn't a place for them to get stuck and they don't have much static cling anyway.
__label__1 THIS BOOKS ...!: I started doing the first few lessons in chapter 1 to get used to the new features of MX. Most of them dont work! Plus I had a whole folder flash files (the files for chapters 1-7) that would not open in Flash. The site for this book ... really bad. Its not made in Flash, which show how much the authors really know, LOL. The files are just thrown in their, leaving you to have to browse through arcane named files that usually dont make sense anyhow. The way the book is written, the authors/flash novices seem to expect you to know what files you need. Its a constant steam of read, download file, read a little more, download a file or two, read a little more, etc. etc. I'm sure its a great book overall, but when I find myself getting frustrated for several hours and still being on the same lesson, I say forget it. I'm taking it back and buying a better book, one that whose authors know how to explain stuff.
__label__2 Amazing: I really enjoyed how two people from two different worlds were able to find love. They accepted each other as an individual and not try to change their ways or thoughts. I knew love would prevail because opposites always attract. It was a joy to read how their love would finally come to life and how they would let it take over. There was suspense and adventure in this story and a lot of history. This is a book I would recommend and I will read it again.
__label__2 Scrumptious!: Tasty recipes from whole grain bakeries fill this creatively designed book from beginning to end. All recipes use whole grains and not one grain of sugar. These are the recipes that will adorn my table for several years and are easy enough to teach children to use. It's a MUST HAVE for those wanting a 100% wholesome food recipe book.
__label__2 Super cute: I bought this for my 3 year old and my 7 and 9 year old fight over it as well. It is well made and large enough for all of them. It doesn't look like it, but it is a girl doctor.
__label__1 So disappointed.: I was planning on buying this game, but I won't purchase something with this kind of DRM. So disappointing. Looks like a fun game too.I'll buy it when EA removes the SecureROM from it.
__label__2 New Upcoming Artist.: Excellent, smooth music, great jazz insight, excellent: Style,mix,encouraging,relaxing,uplifting, I recommend it to all smooth jazz lovers. You will enjoy your new CD.
__label__1 Absolute Garbage: I am ashamed at giving more money to Donald. He is like a neglected child looking for attention with all his name dropping and pointing at all his toys... oh look at my private jet... oh here's a picture of me.... you can see all my stuff from my personal helicopter. Just plain crap. Ive burnt my copy.. have you?
__label__2 Helping Your Dyslexic Child: A Step-By-Step Program for Help: Easy to read. The best part about this book is that it gives you actual exercises to do with your child to help them. For this reason alone I am going to purchase this book.
__label__1 A decent effort: "Night dancing" and "Do you think that's fair?" gives us a hint of what to come later on, when John Cougar Mellencamp released his strongest album ever by the name of "Lonesome jubilee". But this album was released many years earlier while he still used to call himself John Cougar and it's not a great effort, except for the two mentioned songs. I guess a dedicated fan will find pleasure in this album but the casual listener should go for "Lonesome jubilee" or "Scarecrow".
__label__2 Ryan's Return: This was a surprise. Great read. Hard to put down. Great new author for me. I will read more of her books. If you are a Debbie Macomber fan this is a great story!
__label__2 We are all Brothers and Sisters: The boy on the cover is depicted as a kin to the band personnel on the inner page. There is a small girl at the back of the cd cover. In this album which is a tribute to recently died bassist Berry Oakley, we see Oakley in 3 of the songs. Lamar Williams is the new bassist in 4 other songs. Les Dudek is another added guitarist. We see 4 songs 'Ramblin Man', 'Southbound', 'Jessica' and 'Pony Boy' composed by D. Betts. Others are by Gregg Allman. 'Wasted Words' opens the album. The very popular 'Ramblin Man'[When it's time for leaving,i hope you understand, 'cause i was born a ramblin' man]-Rambling=wandering) and 'Come and Go Blues' and 'Jelly Jelly' take us to 'Southbound'[Lord i'm southbound,lord i'm comin' home to you]. 'Southbound' is a vibrant boogeey song.The instrumental epic- 'Jessica' makes you wonder how such a harmony in instrumentation and complexity are possible. 'Pony Boy' features slide guitar playing by Mr. Dickey Betts.
__label__1 SKIP THIS BOOK!: Really terrible first novel, trying to continue reading it gave me a headache.I recommend you read "ALONE" followed by "HIDE" and not waste your time on this.By the way, there is no such time as "oh seven hundred thirty". The correct terminology would be "zero seven thirty hours". This mistake is repeated and very annoying
__label__1 irritating. awful. failure.: this book is MISERABLY BAD. the first half is ok...but the second part is so terribly, off-the-wall, ridiculously bad that i couldn't even finish it. the characters are supremely one dimensional. the story is boring. the actions in the second half are cartoonish and, frankly, insulting. it sounds like something someone wrote in a high school creative writing class. i hated every character in this book. it is now at the bottom of a cage full of mice being torn apart for nesting material. i guess it's good for something!
__label__1 Music Match Jukebox: I had MM jukebox on my other computers for years and I love it. I purchased a new computer and could not get MM jukebox to download from the internet so I purchased the cd but I couldn't get it to load or run properly. I do love Music Match and still want it but I don't know what to do as of now.
__label__2 Generally a Great Book: Patriots vividly brings to life the men behind the Amerucan Revolution. It deals in depth with the causes behind the war, but it's only drawback would have to be the way in which Langguth quickly wrapped up the war by spending only about a hundred and fifty pages on the years between the Declaration of Independence and the British defeat at Yorktown. All in all though, Patriots is an excellent book.
__label__1 Xbox 360 Prices: When the Xbox 360 came out, I think it costs around $400. The Xbox 360 is way overpriced, and I think Microsoft did a bad thing in releasing a bunch of defective Xbox 360s. The price is outrageous, and, according to a freind of mine, has very little internal memory and requires a memory card to play games (Oblivion, for example) the way they were designed to play. Plus, $60 a game is laughable.
__label__2 Pretty decent for what it costs: I bought this to use during my pregnancy and it does its job, took a few minutes to inflate and seems pretty sturdy, no harsh chemical smell and I like that it is a neutral pearly white color. I am 5 ft 6 in tall and this ball seems the right size for my height but a small for my 6 ft tall husband.
__label__1 Didn't realize it would NOT play in my DVD player!!!: Very dissapointed that I purchased a DVD, get it and then come to find out that it will not play in any of my DVD players in the house!!! After reading the back of the box, it says it is from the UK and only works in certain players...ugh! Thought I read eveything carefully when I was ordering it, but obviously did not and now have this movie that cannot be watched. Consumers beware!!!
__label__1 Worst Classic Dream: I liked the first 5-or-so minutes of the opener which evokes some Egyptian pyramid. Then it transitions into mediocre fare, and the next two songs continue the mediocrity. The last song, with the horrendous vocals, was thankfully a one-time experiment! "Alpha Centauri", "Green Desert", and "Zeit" are much better early TD. On the other hand, maybe the new remastered version will reveal the songs in a better way.
__label__1 It Sucks!: I Was Told It Would Work With My La Cross Weather Station, Well It Does Not Work.I Will Never But Anything From La Cross Again.
__label__2 Finally: This "bean bag" is the answer for me (finally) to locate my Garmin above the center console on a flat area of the dash on my Subaru Outback. No more suction cup failures or cables draped over the steering column. Garmin is now positioned perfectly for viewing by both front seat passengers. Also, it stays put.
__label__1 Um, widescreen?: What is the deal? The people who release surf films on DVD must be the most backward thinking people in the film industry. I mean, this was shot on film and released in theaters. Why no widescreen? Same thing with Dogtown, The Billabong Odyssey, and others. This is a travesty. Guys...wake up!!!
__label__1 what a load of shit: Yr wyf yn Gymro Cymraeg o Gymru. Nid oes ond llwyth o gachu yn y llyfrau hyn. Nid oes neb yng Nghymru yn ddigon twp i gredu'r rwts hyn. Americanwr tew a diddeall sydd yn eu hysgrifennu - un o'r enw William Wheeler.I am a Welshman. There is nothing but absolute rubbish in these books. Nobody in Wales is stupid enough to believe this. It is an intellectually stunted American called William Wheeler who writes them. He has been in Wales twice and is the poorest historian I have ever seen in my life. He is a dangerous fantasist who does not live in the real world. Enter at your peril.A group is exposing his lies:Join the growing crowd of voices who are fighting agains his tyrranny.Rhuddlwm@yahoogroups.com
__label__1 overrated: I purchased this as an LP when it was first released and had fond memories of it. In retrospect, it seems a bit slight and not particularly deep. The songs are smooth but not all that deep. The passage of time has not been kind to this album.
__label__2 great early fat release: i think this came out the same time as "the longest line"(nofx) just as fat records was kicking off.a few listens and you are completely hooked.listen out for fat mike singing on mr coffee.
__label__1 Not very helpfull: The usefull information in this book could be condensed into about 50 pages. Most of the book is fictitious conversations between students and instructor and serves as filler. You will not be proficiant at VB after reading this book. This books not only asumes no prior programming experience, but apparently no prior knowledge of Windows as well. For example, this book provides instruction on how to create a new folder in Windows. Unless you are truly new to computers, I think this book would be a disapointment.
__label__1 Maybe for older wiggles fans?: My son was an offical wiggles addict and we watched Toot Toot until the tape wore out, however, he never got into this video. My thought is that it was over his head. It was not the same as the other video, it jumped around a lot and there was not as much singing and dancing as the other videos. I am going to pull it back out now that he is a bit older. I would just be cautious with this video, it didn't go over well with my son, but worth a try again!
__label__1 One Long Dumb Blond Joke: This movie was stupid with a capital "C." It reminded me of the afterschool specials without a point. It didn't make me laugh out loud nor did the legal profession get this great boost of Elledom. Thank God I waited until it appeared on cable. I love Reese, but this movie sucked wind - what was the bunny suit about - oh my gosh I thought it was a costume party. Clueless was so much better than this - legally blond is a poor imitation. Superficial socialite and even dumber trial - this really leads me to believe that blonds do have more fun because had this been any other actress like a younger Sandra Bullock - her career would have been over. Wait a second, scratch that if it had been Nicole Kidman everyone would have been "what was she thinking." Reese is such a smart young lady and I feel that this movie made money because of her personality and her cuteness.
__label__2 great for flip.: Got this tripod to have a way to mount my flip ultrahd. Great if you are making movies from a stationary position. I would recommend one with an arm if you are trying to make movies where you can move the camera. Other than that, its a pretty simple-to-use tripod.
__label__2 Who needs drugs???: "Angels with Dirty Faces" is definitely not party music, unless it's a party full of stoners and heroin addicts. Throw your bongs and needles away! "Angels" is dark, gloomy, erotic, and euphoric without the mind numbing affects of drugs. His electronical blues leaves me begging for more.
__label__1 My least favorite Asaro novel...: I have become a Skolian junkie and was very excited to get this book since it was one that won some awards and was highly touted in the series. When I read it, I found this one to be way more insipid romance novel than the other books in the series. I like the dynamic she usually finds between the sci-fi and romance. This was beyond bad in terms of plot and dialog. This was a painfully cheesy read and really disappointing. I am glad it was not the first one I picked up or I would not have bothered with any of the other books.
__label__2 The Admiral's Bride (Tall, Dark and Dangerous): I enjoyed this book. I like reading Suzanne Brockmann's books. I was not impressed that the cover had changed and I purchased this book twice.
__label__2 Sansa Base Station: If you use you Sansa a lot like I do you can't always hook it up to your PC to charge it. The base Stations makes it a little easier to charge the unit and to sync it up to you PC and transfer files. Its a convenience thing and it works great.
__label__1 Not very good: I have read several Johanna Lindsey novels that I have enjoyed, and this was not one of them. I couldn't stomach the spanking that she felt she deserved for being bad, and the other instances of punishment. This man was not a hero a woman should run to, but should run from.
__label__2 What I have been waiting for!!!!!!: In the era of Mtv inspired pretty faced bands with no talent, it was truly a wonderful suprise to listen to this record. I have not been able to stop!!!! Without a doubt one of the finest recordings I have heard in years. THIS IS WHERE MUSIC SHOULD BE HEADING. People, turn off your tvs, stop listening to what Mtv says you should be listening to and buy this record. It will expand your mind. It is BRILLANT!
__label__2 good utility: I use this instrument daily (with my iMac garage band sofeware) for choir practice to make sure I stay on pitch. I like that I can use garage band to easily alter the pitch of the keyboard. Usually I set A (abvove middle c) to 440 mHz for modern music, but I may set it to 435 for Baroque music. I also like having a keyboard that is light weight and I can store it under a bench. Right now I have the keyboard on my ironing board next to my computer. The ironing board is adjustable and gives it a secure base. So I can wait to buy a stand until the stock market recovers - no matter how long that takes.
__label__2 overall it is good: The reason why i bought this one is because the recommendation from some product review websites. People can spend just 30 dollars to get a router, but if you want something with better quality, spending $60 on this one is worth. Besides the price and the ugly looking, nothing can be complained. I bought it two months ago, so far so good.
__label__2 Surprisingly well done: Why surprising? Er, because it's a coffee table book about weed. I was expecting good photos, but the book also provides an informative and well written intro by Robert Connell Clarke (one of the foremost authorities on mj), well edited descriptions of the many strains, interesting supplementary topics from the mind of Jason King (e.g., vaporization), and excellent layout and design. And the photos are fantastic, particularly the microscopic shots. I give it four stars instead of five only because I would have liked to see more. Bring out Cannabible II, with the scratch and sniffs.
__label__1 Worst gun ever!!!: It broke on the first day i got it.Double Eagle MP40 WWII Spring Airsoft Machine Gun Rifle Airsoft Gun
__label__1 Wii Tiger golf: Graphics are real grainny, poor quality gets old real quick. Needs work should be really cool in a couple of Versions. But now my guys dont even bother with it.
__label__1 Not up to par: I bought this play yard to contain an older pet while I was working. It was fine for about 3 weeks then became more difficult to open. After about 4 weeks it began to break and as of the 5th week, it became totally useless. I should've spent the $60 on a sturdier child gate. This is a cheap, plastic piece of junk! So if you plan to use this more than once or twice a year, probably you should keep looking.
__label__1 Worst Book Ever!: This book turned me off right from the start. It contains scene after scene of sadistic violations and assorted methods of torture, nonconsensual of course. I thought of it as similar to one long rape scene from a prison movie, made even more loathsome by telling us as readers, to want the slave to identify with the oppressor.In actuality this book deserves zero stars. Of all the books I have read, this one ranks right at the bottom of the list.
__label__1 Sony Bravia Television break after one year: DO NOT BUY A SONY BRAVIA TELEVISION. They work for one year and then break. They then try to upsell you on a new television when you call to get a repair.
__label__1 Scarier than 'The Exorcist'? I think not. . .: This is probably one of the biggest let-downs in cinema. Hyped as being scarier than 'The Exorcist', it turned out to be nothing but bad videography sprinkled with a liberal dose of vulgarity. And the plot? Three young people throw away their map and walk themselves to the point of exhaustion in circles in the woods, crossing the same stream numerous times. Did anyone think to actually follow the stream downstream? I actually found myself rooting for the 'Blair Witch' at the end. Anyone that stupid deserved to be put out of their misery. As for being scarier than 'The Exorcist', as was claimed in many cinema reviews at the time of its release, this movie doesn't even come close. If you haven't seen 'The Blair Witch', do yourself a favor -- save your money and go see the re-release of 'The Exorcist' at the theater.
__label__1 People Fall Asleep!: Althought this movie is absolutely clean, while I was watching this movie I thought I'm not getting any younger here! The movie can be long, drawn out and boring.
__label__2 Excellent work!!!: The last couple Midnight Oil albums have been somewhat disappointing to me, but I thought I'd order this one to give it a listen, boy, I'm glad I did. The tunes are catchy enough to pull you in, but diverse to make you want to listen to them over and over and they continue to grow on you. I've always thought these guys had the knack for writing almost anthemic songs, this CD is an excellent example of that. Buy it, you will not be disappointed!
__label__1 Same as two other albums?: While I haven't heard this particular release, the song titles and the other review make it almost certain to be the same recordings that are on both "Small Town Blues" and "Groovin' Is Easy." As the other reviewer said a little more pointedly, not the best way to appreciate the Electric Flag. "A Long Time Comin'" is definitely a great album, especially for Mike Bloomfield fans like myself.
__label__2 politeness's downside: We often say we wish people were as polite now as they were in the 1950s, but we forget the downside: that politeness on our parts would be necessary & that would be inconvenient. But on further reflection, it might be good for us, as it was for Dulcie. She didn't really want her niece to move in, but thought she owed it to her sister, & it livened her life a little. She really, really didn't want Viola as a boarder, either, but Viola became a co-conspirator in investigating Aylwin.For me, one of the tests of a good book is wondering what might happen afterwards to the characters. Will Viola's husband-to-be be sorry he married someone who can't cook & is a sloppy housekeeper? Will Dulcie be able to forget that Aylwin was interested in her niece? and so on
__label__2 best yet: travis meeks shines on this cd....yet another great cd from a great artist...if you dont have it, get it!
__label__1 wtf: lol. these things rip so easily. i dont understand why people waste money on soft pads. save your money for a cf pad. its pricy, but well worth it. 1 star is too much for soft pads piece of craps.
__label__2 used book: used book in good condition. It came with the cd's- great value for the price! So glad I found this one!
__label__1 Not that useful...: Since Dirtblaster was pretty much a requirement for the electrical powerwashers I automatically got one for my gas driven one(Karcher G2500OH). So far I have had no use for it.With the dirtblaster nozzle you do get higher pressure, but I found it a little too uneven. If you are not careful you may ruin you concrete surface(as I did). To me a waste of money. The default nozzles for my powerwasher are good enough...
__label__2 An excellent buy: I'll add my five cents to the generally very favourable reviews here. I've had the XT1 speaker system for three months now, and carried it all around the Americas with me. It packs up nicely in the carrying case, plugs in with no fuss, and the sound is amazing for such a small unit -- clean and clear, and easily filling an ordinary-sized room. I also use them as my standard laptop speakers at home -- while they don't rattle the walls like some of Altec Lansing's larger bass-heavy units, they also connect directly to the USB port, so they don't have the terribly annoying static buzz and interference of many cheaper Altec systems that plug into the wall. One of the nicest computer accessories I've ever bought.
__label__2 The Return of Martin Guerre: The Return of Martin Guerre is a great book because it is very well reserched and is a very easy read for people who are not familar with the history of France. At times the book becomes dry but overall it is a wonderfully compelling story. The story of Martin Guerre seems almost unreal if it did not have historical proof behind it. The story sounds like something out of a hollywood movie which makes the story very compelling. The movie of the same title is great but read the book before seeing the movie. Together they give a great understanding of France during this period
__label__2 FORGET THE REST, PLAY THE BEST.: My son introduced me to the first commandos,behind enemy lines.I Could not stop playing it until Beyond the call of duty came out. Now I go back and forth playing both of them. These games have it all. Everything is so real you feel like you are in a mission of combat and not just a game.I spend so much time playing that I had to buy my son his own computer so he can play.My son thanks you for that. I'm getting commandos 2 for my birthday if I can wait another month, but I don't think I can wait that long. I have just 2 words for you guys. THANK YOU.
__label__2 As someone who has been through a custody battle,: I couldn't put this one down. I'm not adopted but when my parents divorced, the whole family wanted to adopt me, and it split my family to this very day, 10 plus years later. The emotions that Gordon felt were very real. You want the best for the child, but if nothing's working in bringing the child to your home, you give up. I love Mitchards writing, and I think this one to be one of her best. Yes there is alot of background information, but as with anything to get a clear picture of a story you need that clarity. She has to detail everything. I couldn't put this book down, and enjoyed it. The ending was quite interesting and unexpected which is a pleasure when you get to the point that you think you could guess the ending to every book when they get formulaic. Pick this one up, with "The Most Wanted" and I guarantee you'll have a weekend worth of excellent reading.
__label__1 If: If you can get past the rock opera thing, you can listen to some good individual songs, like 'Run Like Hell' and 'Comfortably Numb.' If you know what this album is all about, either you're really good at this kind of thing, or you forgot to switch on your s*** detector.
__label__1 Horrible...: This book sucks. It's like a horse tranquilizer it's so boring. If you're thinking about reading this book, don't. I was so bored I didn't even notice what I was reading about. I give this book 12 thumbs down.
__label__1 boring: This book I was forced to read for a summer reading project. I didnt follow it well, and it is not a quick read. Although there are a few instances where the book is interesting but it wasn't enough for me to keep reading. I would have liked if this book had been more easy to follow, because there were many parts where Afar Nafisi would go off and start talking about a thing of the past, and confuse me. It's not the most exciting book ever but it does give a look it to the life of a tehranian women.
__label__1 Awful!: First I should disclose that I didn't finish this book. I got about halfway through before I couldn't take it anymore. I love BDSM erotica, and I often enjoy stories with non-consensual things such as this one--kidnapping and such. So prudishness is not the reason I disliked this book. It was just terrible...not erotic or sexy to me at all. There is no erotic energy between Deborah and any of the men, and they weren't interesting or sexy characters at all. The dialogue basically consists of "On your knees bitch", "Suck it bitch", "I'm gonna put you in a cage bitch". Seriously, it was that bad. I wouldn't recommend this, it's just not hot at all!
__label__2 Mind-blowing: I read this book as a part of my studies in Eastern philosophy, in particular Indian philosophy, and the only term I can come up with is "mind-blowing". I considered myself an agnostic until I read this book... This book contains within the basis of the Jain religion, as well as many philosophical points which students of Eastern (and in particular Indian) philosophy and religion cannot ignore. Truly the best and most comprehensive text on the subject of Jainism.
__label__2 Not so good, but...: Ape Escape 2 is not so good but it works. Really. The graphics are good, the music is good, the voices are terrible and the gameplay sucks. The tank vehicle is so boring it has gotta be illegal. But this game isn't so bad. That's it.
__label__2 G600 is simple and produces excellent photo prints: I have had this printer for about six months and am very pleased with the results. The printer comes with a "starter pack" that will print 5 to 7 pictures so you will want to get an additional paper pack. The output is excellent - as an amateur, I cannot discern the difference between these photos and those from the photo lab. They even have "Kodak" printed on the back of the paper! I have printed about 50 pictures so far with NO snags. This is the best photo printer I have owned (much more reliable than the PictureMate by Epson with its "cloggy" print head and you can touch the photo right away without smudging unlike the full-size HP Photo Printer PSC-2210). The largest picture pack will give you prints for about $0.20 each - not too bad to get instant results!
__label__2 PERFECT!!: I wasn't even a Madonna fan until I read this book. Taraborrelli does an INCREDIBLE job and has converted me to Madonna 'fanhood'. Revealing, exciting and most of all addictive, I read An Intimate Biography cover to cover in two days.Excellent book choice for any Madonna fan, or like me,pepole not even interested. You'll be pleasently suprised what the combination of Madonna and Taraborrelli have to offer. You won't be disappointed!
__label__2 WTF is with the mixed reviews for this awesome CD?: I loved this cd. Full on energy from the first song to the last. I can't believe that people that apparently knew of the datsuns enough to buy this cd can think it is ok or bad? They are high energy, garage rock with some KILLER riffs. The media loved them when they first came out. I wonder what happened to the hype from the media? The Datsuns wondered this too apparently, with the second lp named "Outta Sight, Outta Mind". Oh well, I think everything about this album is great and there is not one song on there that is filler to me.
__label__1 Defective: I loved the look of the shoe and the fit. I am a nurse who woks 12 hour shifts and I needed a good fitting shoe. However, I wore the shoes for 2 shifts and then the left shoe began to squeak with everyLeft step. Even my co workers commented so therefore I have to return the shoe.
__label__2 back to ELO?: This is a good dvd but it would be good to see the rest of the band not just Jeff and it was a little to much like he was in a studio not a live concert but I enjoy it !
__label__2 Ahhhhhhhhh: What can I say... Michael Ball's voice just cannot be compared to anyone else. This cd is just one more example of his talent.
__label__1 Washing machine shutoff valves: Blatantly misrepresented. Description says Mfg. by Plumb Pak in the United States.Part # PP2056. When received they came from Ace Hdwe. and plainly says Made in China. Thouroughly disgusted and not very happy with Amazon.
__label__1 Dangerous and cheap as they rust and break!!!: I had these scissors for just under two years (received them as a wedding gift in June 2005). The started to rust in under a year, and then the handles started slipping. Eventually the plastic on the handles cracked, while I was cutting some chives. The process of the plastic cracking pinched and cut my skin. I actually kept the scissors around for another few weeks as the "scissor part" still worked, but then the other handle cracked and the plastic fell off. My grandmother has had the same kitchen scissors for nearly 50 years...
__label__2 carrot cake and pumpkin flavor: These arent like other "energy bars" They are made with oats and grains, and they are delicious. They are very convenient to carry in your gym bag, coat pocket , or in a desk drawer. Perfect for someone like me that doesnt eat breakfast much. High n fiber too.Carrot Cake is my favorite. I was happy to discover the "Pumpkin pie" flavor in the seasonal isle at the health food store...lol. Very good.Highly recommend then.
__label__1 Parts Missing: My chair was received without all of the parts. I was told that I could send back the chair and get a refund. Keep the chair (that I can't put together) at a 10% discount. Or send the chair back and get a new one in 3-5 weeks. It only took me 2 weeks to get it the first time. Instead of offering service (free expedited shipping, faster delivery, etc), I got customer service agents regurgitating computer automated responses. The chair may be nice when it's put together, but I wouldn't know.
__label__2 Decent but not as good as the original: My wife and I did enjoy it, but not as much as the original Thou Shalt Laugh. The original was hilarious, this one was moderately funny. a couple of the comedians didn't deserve to be in there. We did appreciate the Christian context and that all the comedians kept it clean.
__label__1 Not worth the hype!!!!: I bought this product, hoping that it would be a much better version and versatile than its predecessors. Compared to NIS 2006, NIS 2007 isn't intuitive and doesn't have much of customisable features. Ad-blocking and Popup-blockers have been removed from NIS. You can't specify this product to block particular internet sites as opposed to NIS 2006.I am not that impressed by this product anymore as it does nothing more than slowing down your machine.
__label__1 $6.99??!!!! Really: As if the Washington/Wallstreet complex has not raped us enough.....$7 dollars for a rental on how others screwed with our money??? Really??? NO Thanks!!
__label__2 Cruisin For A Bruisin: Taken simply as satire, this album works just fine. But what a lot of people didn't get at the time was that it also worked as progressive (don't laugh) doo-wop with chord progressions that showed the original Mothers as one of the most talented bands of their generation.Musically, it's all over the place, but "Fountain Of Love" and "Stuff Up The Cracks" are two of the most underrated tunes in the Zappa catalogue. If you're a fan of such later efforts as "Joe's Garage" or "Lather", you probably shouldn't bother with this one.But if you're a true music lover with an acute sense of humour, it's more than worth the purchase.
__label__2 Great Booster Seat!: My 3 1/2 year old was more than ready for this booster. She loves it! We can take it w/ us to Gramma's or on the road. It's light, portable and easy for our daughter to use. It cleans up well, too. Just a little soap and water to get rid of food or spilled liquid. I like that it 'sticks' to the seat of a chair, so there isn't any movement (even though your child may be wiggly!). If your child will sit nicely at the table and doesn't need the safety straps, this booster seat is great!
__label__2 The Next GRAMMY Winner: WHen you play this cd the first song will automatic put your body in motion.Rufus has taken gospel music to a whole different direction and level with this cd. For those of you who love to hear the late Roger Troutman perform on his famed talk box; well try this MASTERPIECE. These songs keep your head boppin'at all times ( even the slower songs ). Once you listen to this cd all the way through; i know you will start it all over again; THAT'S A PROMISE.
__label__1 Terrible!!!! Do Not Buy!!: Do not buy. This Gate is awful! Zero Stars! It did not come as pictured. The pressure fit knobs shown in the photo are instead flat plastic (which is useless) and the 'nuts' that would presumably keep the knobs in place are enormous. The problem? Once assembled, the doggie door does not close and the gate does not pressure fit in doorway. Completely useless.
__label__2 Precise control and very ergonomical: Kinda tough to write meaningful things about a mouse but I bought this one for myself to use at work, as the replacement for an older Logitech wireless mouse that was end-of-lifecycle.This mouse is not as small as you might think. I am 6 ft and 200 lbs and this fits comfortable in my hands (no I do not have little hands!).Also, my desk is high gloss cherry wood and my old mouse would go awol once in a while due to the darkness and grain. This mouse is flawless an precisely controllable.The battery last very long as it goes to powersave when you do not use it.When I travel I put the usb dongle in the back of the mouse for storage which shuts off the power and keeps me from losing the dongle part.This mouse if also rather heavy which makes it easier to control when moving around as it helps make smooth movements.Loved it so much I bought the same for my wife (she loves it too) and my kids (a tad too big for a 10 yr olds' hands).
__label__1 poor faith: I feel so sorry for Faith Hill. This cd is the worst ever. I really love faith but this cd bummed me out.. It is not country and there isnt even 1 song that sounds it. When i bought this album I had the choice of Faith hill "cry" and Tim's new one and I chose Faith's and I truely regret it. I should have read the reviews. But if you enjoy pop/R&B I recommend it.
__label__2 Great second album: This album deserves a lot more words than I will say here, but I will try to cover everything: this is a brilliant album. Some will say it rips off Linkin Park. I beg to differ-i am probably LP's biggest fan, and it took me about 20 listens to Darkhorse to draw a minor comparison.This is a very deep album, full of anthems for the disenfranchised; lighter tunes reminiscent of "Butterfly"; and pondering, hurt semi-ballads. You can tell that Crazy Town put a lot of effort towards making an excellent album (at which they succeeded), but also to escape the pre-conceived "Butterfly boys" perception. I strongly suggest you purchase this album, and approach it with an open mind.
__label__2 Danforth legacy lives on: Danforth's story shows that meager monetary or intellectual beginnings don't necessarily dictate future achievements. You'll find lessons substantial enough to change your thinking and, therefore, your course in life. Section on physical exercise, while totally on target in concept, is outdated given how much more we know today.
__label__2 Great product!: I'm not a hardcore gamer at all; I did not have any handheld gaming console before, but this is absolutely fun to play, to learn, to read at a appealing price!
__label__2 GREAT CD: I have really enjoyed this CD by Glenn Frey. All the songs are easy to listen to and I especially like the two that were part of the Miami Vice TV show. It is a definite addition to any CD collection.
__label__1 The Planet Of The Bubbleheaded Bimbos!: Star Trek the Next Generation was and still is one of my favorite TV shows and I'm a fan who actually likes Wesley Crusher though I do admit that they sometimes went a little overboard with the whole boy genius thing but anyway This is not my favorite Wesley Crusher episode, and I agree that this episode is like watching a really bad B movie and I can just see Mystery Science Theater making fun of this episode and the goofy characters from the planet of the bimbos and their cheap flimsy costumes! Out of every episode made of Star Trek: The Next Generation I only disliked a few episodes and this is one of my least favorite ones.
__label__1 Waste of Money: I dont like this DVD at all..all the cast is just so boring and its kinda worth waste of money
__label__2 And then they made me their cheif...: This film shines like aztec gold! Johnny mad a superb Captain Jack Sparrow! It is my favorite movie EVER!!!!! Keira and Orlando made a cute couple, Geoffrey was cool, and Jack (the monkey ^-^) was adorable, but I must say, Depp stole the movie! Influenced by Keith Richards and Pepe Le Pew, he made a hilarious (and slightly drunken) Sparrow! 5 stars, MUST see! If you don't like it you need a medication.
__label__1 NOT SO FAST: If you put the disc in your comp- you find out they wrote this album in three weeks!!!! IT SHOWS!!!!!!!! None of these tracks are worth many listens- except maybe STREAM- (agree with reviewer below) but unlike the moron below- 3 stars is too much- to be soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disapointed by this band pisses me off- like a friend betrayed you--- I USED TO LOVE DT- NOW I JUST LIKE THEM- bring on symphony x, vanden plas, and pagan's mind!!!! ( yes i know these bands are all heavily influenced by DT- dont care!!)
__label__2 Bose Acoutimass: Great sound, compact design for smaller areas, not too expensive in my opinion. Only thing is I was not thinking about needing a center speaker to use as part of a surround sound so that's my mistake! Luckily Amazon has just the center speaker to buy because Bose does not sell it alone. Works very well with my Onkyo. I thought about buying the Cinemate series, which would have been a little less expensive, because you don't need a receiver but you can't expand onto the system.
__label__2 Numbers 1 2 3: I like the size and quality of the book and sincerely hope my son and his wife will use it to help prepare my grandson for kindergarten.
__label__1 Worst: Disappointed again. Surely he sells books - lots of them. But he probably ran out of stories. Not worth the money.
__label__2 One of the HEAVIEST records of all time!!!: If you are a true fan of heavy music, do yourself a really big favor and get this record. The first two songs are some of the baddest rock-n-roll ever made. I searched for this CD for ten years and when I finally found it, it was EVEN BETTER than I remembered. ROCK OUT!!!
__label__2 Fantastic! Highly Recommend: Everyone should read this book/cookbook, it is so much more it has loads of information.
__label__2 Xtreme DVD: I have seen most of the Inuyasha episodes on adult swim late nights. The Inuyasha series intreges me because it has a mixture of all film types. What I wish to state is that this series has a love story like a drama movie. The story has some grand action like an action movie. Most of all, it has alot of mystery in each episode that keeps me thinking about what will happen next(that aspect is very hard to judge even after finding all the needed details. I saw this DVD with a friend of mine who is intreged by anime films. He and I both agree this movie is a must see for fans of the show, and many anime fans across the world.
__label__2 Awe Inspiring: Despite negative press in the underground metal community, and somewhat lousy production to boot, Therion still succeeds in transending the usual tired crop of "look what I can do!" bands of similar build with "Beyond Sanctorum". The sound is very progressive and experimental, and I have to disagree with one of my fellow reviewers who called this a "transition to a transition album". True, this album falls right before Therion steers their sound into a tight symphonic metal outfit, but that is just how the chips fall. This is TRUE metal. Complex, brilliant, and often wandering into beatiful grinding sonic passages that one with an ear tuned to fine musicianship will appreciate. Need proof? Listen to "The Way", an astonishing 11-minute saga laden with perfectly layered guitar work and exotic insturments. Yes, the sound on this album is a little muddy, but don't let that detract you from experiencing one of metal's most overlooked and underrated death metal albums.
__label__2 Great energy bar: I came home and just wanted to grab something small before doing some exercise. Those bars just had arrived and I figured I might as well. Boy, they are something else. Very moist and solid with a not overly sweet taste. Exceedingly delicious. Best of all, its all natural. The only downside I found is that the quality and richness of flavor comes with an almost 200 calorie price tag. But compared to other bars, this is clearly the winner.
__label__1 not as good as it could have been (SPOILERS): This started out strong. Story was good, well written. But for the level of emotion that should have been assoc. with the Crime in the end... IT was lacking.
__label__2 Great Show!: This show is very good! I love the relationships and how the family grows, reacts, etc. to everything that happens. They show love, family, good relationships, patience, kindness, goodness, and many more family-honoring Christian traits. You see Christianity in action (even if it is a little watered down). I like the fact that it's a show of a pastor, his wife and family. It's the first time that I've really seen what a Christian relationship (especially between a pastor and his wife) really should/could be. What you believe (your worldview...whether it's Christianity, atheism, Islam, etc.) is a real part of everyday life...it's who you are.
__label__1 Sangean Pocket Radio: This product has been a disappointment from the start. The channel selected is not the channel the radio receives for example when tuned to FM 94.5 the channel received is 101.2. I called Datavision and was connected to someone that could care less. He said to send it to the manufacturer which I did. The radio came back with the same problem. I had to pay for shipping plus an additional six dollars with no results. I won't be buying from either company in the future.
__label__1 Liberal sisters growing greyer, wrinkled, fewer-yet jubilant: Sister Schneiders' book is a fascinating read. But not for the reasons she would want. She exudes a self-congratulatory tone --which she shares with an ever-dwindling puddle of radicalized & wrinkled women religious. Why are they getting greyer, fewer, and more self-absorbed? Together they seem to be celebrating an outworn 60's-style radicalism that remains as defiant as it is barren. For those who want to find real treasure, study Mother Theresa...
__label__2 the best & greatest info on 2 pac .: This is going to be the best release on anything that was said about the greatest artist off our life time. I just got done with Frank Alexander's book Got Your Back it is unbeliveable especially all the things he been through in his life growing up in the projects of Chicago and living day to day with a person like 2pac and being responsible for his every day actions.That alone was a great task for one man to take.My hat goes out to Frank for what he has done and is doing bye allowing us the public to see all that went on the last year off the Worlds Greatest rapper off all times 2pac.So continue you efforts in everything you get involved with, hopefully a movie next based on you book Got Your Back I know it would be great.You will have fans for along time following you and your future projects.Good luck 2pac's greatest fans.
__label__1 Dont waste your money: The first time we brought this to the pool the plastic piece that keeps the front wheel on snapped off. The back wheels are too thin especially for the beach and sand. Not worth it!
__label__2 Tiny and Bright Light right where i needed it!: Don't let the size of these little fellas concern ya. I purchased them to fit in the small openings in my grill, they fit perfect. The kit comes with lots of different wiring options, all with safety fuse blocks. The lights project a intense wide light. Our Bronco has 10 inches of lift,factory lights just can't put the light down low and to the sides, these little guys fill the spots i needed. Now if i could only find a light bar for the bumper for some big Hella's! Excellent product,just don't expect 500 or 1000 watt performance from a 55 watt light.. :) MB
__label__1 Product did not work as I had expected.: Product was difficult to insert. After insertion gas was directed into the wine. As a result the wine erupted when the cork came out. Used an excessive amount of gas to expel cork. Cartridge was useable for only a few bottles. Company Rep indicated there was no defect in the product. Also the product can only be used with standard 750 ml. bottles. This last fact was only seen after I received the item. Not agood experience!
__label__2 Never Disappointed!: I anticipated the release date for this album for about a month. The day it came out I was at the record store to pick up my copy. When I got home to listen to it, I was not disappointed. All of the anticipation was not wasted. I have to say that this was one of the best albums that I've bought in quite some time (and I buy a lot of music). Usually when I buy an album I only hear three or four songs that I really like but I loved every song on this album and I've played it to death since I bought it almost a month ago! This album is full of excellence--musically, lyrically, and performance wise. It's well worth the adding to your collection today!
__label__1 Yuck - do NOT buy this...!!!: Save your money - I wish I had...everything about this product is a disappointment. Who knew macadamias and coconut (two of my favorite things) could taste so bad...can I return seventeen and three quarters of the eighteen that I purchased...? Please?
__label__2 You'll like this!: Wow! My wife bought me this novel because she knew I liked The Man with the Red Tattoo. That was, of course, a James Bond novel. So, my childhood biases were there to make me buy it in the first place. Having this other R.B. novel in front of me, I decided to give it a read. I was not disappointed. The characters and story are well-developed, and you are drawn to them and the action of novel as soon as you pick it up. I really think that R.B. is a talented storyteller. You will not be disappointed.
__label__1 What the.....?: I've read countless numbers of Sci-Fi and fantasy tales and The Gift definately ranks as one of the lowest to me. The storyline had such great potential but the author chose not to use it. The plot jumps around as if the author wrote a chapter and stopped for a month then returning without looking back at what he previously wrote. The narrative was also somewhat childish. I looked forward to this book after reading the reviews. What a let down it proved to be! Mr. O'Leary please use better focus next time!!Adult reader Near Chicago.
__label__1 "father" riker: interesting. betty lewis: amateur.: the story of holy city is intriguing and the research for this book was thorough enough, but it is about the worst written book i have ever read. totally intolerable if you are not quite curious about the subject matter. the whole thing essentially consists of nonsequiturs and the information is not really organized into chapters as advertised. there are two misspellings on the very first page. the typography is terrible as well: reckless capitalization; hyphens used for em-dashes; (typewriter) dumb quotes throughout. betty lewis, a respectable local historian, did not appear to have the benefit of any particular skill in composition, nor of an editor.
__label__1 : I can't give you a review since the three DVDs(Thomas The Tank Engine and Friends - It's Great to Be an Engine (Purchased on 01/14/2007, Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends - Best of Gordon (Purchased on 01/14/2007, Thomas and Friends: Thomas' Sodor Celebration! (Purchased on 01/14/2007) were not working.
__label__1 NOT "Pk of 4": I was quite upset when I recieved this product because in the name and description of this product, is says "Pk of 4". I assumed that means that I would get 4 totes with my order. I DID NOT. I only received one (1).
__label__2 Charming, quirky lead: I agree with another reviewer who saw the similarity to LO:CI. KSedgewick gives her character a strange, mannered way of talking and gesturing. She still manages to be lovable and instead of becoming a laughing stock, her interrogation skill gradually wins over her underlings. The supporting cast is top notch too. Also a big cheer for having an integrated racial cast.
__label__2 We love the Mighty Mite vacuum: Our Mighty Mite was purchased as a replacement for our old Eureka Boss vacuum, which served us faithfully for many years until it wore out. The new one is also light weight, has similar attachments, and works with much more power than the old one. It's good for both bare floors and carpet (safe for Orientals), and is easy to manipulate and carry to clean stairs. We are very happy with it and expect it will be as sturdy as the old one.
__label__1 SOUL PLANE WAS A CRASH LANDING: This was without a doubt the WORST movie that I have ever seen. Thankfully, I only rented it. The acting was bad, the story line was tired. I would give this -stars if I could.
__label__2 decent mount... horrible screws: The mount come with the worst quality screws. I like to think I'm a very careful individual when screwing in screws. That said, even using the proper screw bit and speed, the cheap screws stripped and I had the same experience as others struggling to pull out the stripped screw out of the wall. That said, the mount even when mounted level will bend slightly due to the monitor if the mount is extended to one side. However, if extended toward you, it will be fine.
__label__1 Crashes After Install: I just got the package for Windows XP and proceeded to install. During the installation, I updated to the latest and greatest as of Auguest 2004. After reboot, the product crashes with errors for "VirusScanSynchMgrClass: Avsynmgr.exe" and twice "RuLaunch". This is horrific.My system is realatively clean with only Office 2003 (all patches applied), Virtual PC 2004, and Yahoo Messenger on Windows XP Pro (all patches appied).I think products that out of the box crash is just unethical, even more so when the latest patches/updates don't work. It shows that the company either cuts corners on software quality assurance or management that ships the products with known bugs. Either way, this is not the type of company that you want to buy products from period. Aarrrgh!!!
__label__2 great for a small lawn: Great little mower for a small lawn. Just make sure you don't let your grass grow too long between cuttings or it wil bog down.
__label__1 don`t even waste your time with this cd!: Biggie, is probaly the 10 worst ever. Don`t even spend your time even looking at this cd. 2 Pac is like 10 times better then this sob.
__label__2 Pure ear candy: Ella Fitzgerald's voice is pure ear candy. She always retained a freshness and purity in her voice that was amazing to hear. I've been listening to this CD nonstop for about two weeks and still can't get over the sheer beauty of her voice. Her version of "September Song" alone makes this a must, but there are other standout cuts as well, including the lovely and subdued "Reaching for the Moon" and "The Man I Love."
__label__1 Miffed by marinade: I was miffed by a recipe in this book that called for me to marinate london broil on the counter for 2 hours, then freeze for later consumption. I followed the recipe, but after 1 1/2 hours the meat felt warm to the touch and I began to wonder if this was a good idea. Checked meat safety tips online and every one stated: "If your recipe calls for marinating on the counter...don't do it". I expect I will now throw away almost 4 lbs. of london broil as I fear bacteria growth while it was marinating on my counter. This was a big disappointment for me and a waste of money. Other recipes seem interesting, don't know if I'll try them yet.
__label__1 What a joke!: I bought this book unseen from Amazon, hoping, since it came from Macromedia, that it would help me learn the new features in Fireworks 8. Not! Instead this is a barely reworked edition of the one I have had for Fireworks MX!To be fair, I printed out the "What's new in Fireworks 8" from the Fireworks Help, and cross-referenced it with this book's index. Nothing!Perhaps this is a good book for a beginner, but it covers little of Fireworks' better features. and, if you are an experienced Photoshop user, there is nothing for you here. Even worse, the "web site" you will learn to build is totally lame.This is too bad, because there is a lot in Fireworks that I would like to learn. And there is a dearth of literature on this product. Macromedia has said there will be a Fireworks 9. Probably Peachpit will change the cover on this book and market it again...
__label__1 " You is a Wahr-wulf, Paul ???? ": They were wrong, they were SO wrong. The downfall of Hollywood filmmaking should not be attributed to the Star Wars franchise, but instead to THIS piece of tripe. This "film" is an amalgam of inferior B-movies superimposed to make one REALLY bad B-movie. It includes special effects that would make Ed Wood laugh in his grave and the worst foreign accents you will ever hear ( "Weer-wulf ?? Pawwl ?? You is a Weer-wulf ??"). It absolutely astonishes me that this film was made in 1996 and not in 1976 ! The acting is so terrible it makes Rambo II look Oscar-worthy. Keep an out for the scene stealing Inn-keeping Yokel, who himself seems to be a combination of every old-bearded-Hermit-foggie stereotype known to man. Be advised to only watch this disaster if you're a fan of MST3K-style presentations because it makes for one of the best episodes in recent memory. If not, stay away, stay far far away !!!
__label__2 I LOVE THESE CASES!!!!: these cases are amazing!! i love them!! if i ever need to replace one of my dvds i always buy Memorex DVD Storage Cases. there the next best thing, i think to the ones that come orignal with my store bought dvds.thanks Memorex!!
__label__1 Crap battery: I bought the vacuum and loved it's ease. When my battery wouldn't charge any more I ordered a replacement. I opened it, charged it for a few hours and tried it out. 30 seconds and dead, what a piece of crap. I saw all the negatives on these batteries but I spent $40 bucks on this vacuum so I didn't want to think of it as a disposable vacuum, nothing wrong with it but the battery... right. Well, if you can't use it because of the battery something is seriously wrong. The company really needs to rethink the battery.
__label__1 Bug-Ware. Don't Buy It.: Automatic backups work great. System restore (to new drive) does not work at all. I have Win 2K Pro, SP2 installed on 10 GByte IDE Maxtor. Drive is almost full, due to many applications. Used Ghost 9.0 to create an image of the 10 GByte Maxtor (MAX). Been trying to restore to a new drive, a 30 GByte Western Digital (WDC). Have made more than 3 backup images. Have tried to retore images to the 30 GByte WDC 6-7 times. Used different settings and tweaks. It won't work. WDC drive always crashes. Windows blue screen of death. Most frequent error is "autocheck not found". Live-update (Symantec online app maintenance utility) is useless. Tech support does not exist...unless you pay by the minute. I would recommend using freeware or shareware before buying this product. If you disagree, feel free to spend 40-60 hours of your own time understanding the users manual (almost NO technical content.)
__label__1 Blaah: If you are looking for something quick and easy to use this isnt it. Bought this for my last trip to FL and ended up giving up!!
__label__2 Amazing: I was lucky enough to find this at a store. This album is some of the best Psychadalic Prog-Rock you will find. It's just great music. The second disc makes it all the better. Every song on this album is amazing, don't hesitate to get this.
__label__1 You get what you pay for unfortunately: I've been trying to replace my Radio Shack sleep machine, so I thought I'd give this a try. What a waste of money! I guess if you like the sounds of waves in a tin can, you might like it. I'm putting it in my daughter's garage sale.
__label__1 I thought it was the movie: I mistook this for the movie, and I was disapointed with what I got. I will read more careful next time.
__label__1 Nice Effort, Par Outcome film .: i'm afraid that this apt of beauty and the beast is not that good and i loved Pride and Prejudice the latter day version and Charly and the Work And The Glory Films, plus Other Side Of Heaven it had actors that you believed, this movie not so. the actors in this movie were hard to believe, their characters because they were'nt that believeable. they were actually quite funny when not meaning to be I'm sure that's what the screenwriter did'nt have in mind i bet. i hate to give this a bad review but it was just painful to watch mostly, there were a couple of bright spots not many though . this felt like a dress rehersal with the actors fumbling through their parts. nice effort but did'nt make the mark sorry. I liked belle's father he was believeable and the guy playing the beast was good, but those were the only two.Next Time I'm Watching The Disney Version. I'm all for Wholesome Entertainment But it needs to be better in acting , script, etc.
__label__2 Really great travel kit: Bought this for my portable HD. Not only does it fit my P.HD but it also fits the cable, USB drives, other miscellaneous things in this little secure travel pocket!
__label__1 Good news for OpenOffice: Unfortunately, my (public sector) employer still subscribes to the dogma that if it's from Microsoft (or Oracle, or whatever conglomerate you can name), it has to be good. My entire workplace has been afflicted with this garbage for years now. Frankly, taxpayers ought to be irate over the money squandered.To my mind, the single worst thing about this piece of crap is Microsoft's **unilateral** decision to crank up "improved" file formats. Yes, I know that folks can do a "Save As", and I know that one can change the default file type. The point is that most people don't do this consistently, and it's routine to have problems when exchanging documents with other organizations.In a time of unprecedented austerity, it's incredibly galling that public sector organizations at all levels are wasting money on this cancer, when a superior alternative -- OpenOffice -- is available for ZERO dollars.
__label__2 Bank Heist Mega Brand Playset: I purchased this playset for my 6 year old. We spent about 2 hours putting it together one afternoon which was kind of fun and the instructions were easy to follow. It's much sturdier than the Legos Spongebob sets he got last year. The Lego sets fell apart after a couple of times playing with them. This one is still together & hopefully will be for a while. My son enjoys playing with it and likes that it comes with a little Spiderman, Sandman and a police man.
__label__1 worse of all: This shaver is the worse one yet for me to try on my legs.. Leaves me cuts and rashes even when i try and shave slow and steady.. But thats what u get when its you buy something cheap
__label__2 Karajan's Best Bruckner 9th: Of all of the four Karajan Bruckner 9ths (two on DVD), I like this one the best. I like the power and majesty of the first movement. Karajan's tempi are spot on. I've always felt that his later readings seemed "small" in scale, probably because his tempi speed up a bit. That said, I think his weakest performance was on the DGG DVD. I also like his 1979 performance but not as much as this one. For the record this is my favorite performance of this work, however, I highly recommend Haitink's digital performance of this work on the Phillips label.
__label__1 complicated: It might be my computer, but I wasn't able to get it to work. Apparently it is not windows vista compatible. Thank you, Beth Jones
__label__2 Birth As Mother Nature Truly Intended It To Be: Birth Day is an extraordinary film that documents the incredible bond between a mother and her unborn baby and her family. I loved both the simplicity and the spirituality that the film displays through Naoli's recollection and interpretation of the events. In addition, the film displays an overall feeling of peacefulness and calmness in the birthing process that, sadly enough, you don't find very often in the US. I felt that her husbands' participation in the labor and birth process, as well as his contribution to it, was exactly as it should be, but so often is not. As a childbirth educator for The Bradley Method, I have had an opportunity to view many birth videos, and by far this one is exceptional in quality and content.
__label__1 Did not work on arrival -- Customer support was horrible: When I received my Nomad Zen, it was broken. (Bad hard drive). When I called customer support, I was treated to a HORRIBLE experience.I've used creative products for over 10 years, and because of this experience I'm not longer going to buy their products. I can't recommend a product to a user when the company refuses to support their customers. Try something else, perhaps the Apple IPod.I would be happy to provide more details if asked.
__label__2 medicine can be toxic in excess: Ilyich wrote this a generation-plus ago, yet his messages resonate today. We have depersonalized our lives in so many ways, by bringing the industrial model into realms that were meant for emotion, feeling, and art. The influx of industry-thought into medicine has torn the sensitive heart from many care-givers and patients alike. His text is a bit lengthy and is repetitive in spots, and can be challenged on the facts in others. Overall, his concerns about the choices we have made socially and medically remain valid.
__label__2 For those who like hard garage bands: I'm flabbergasted that this album is still in print.I was introduced to this band back in 1998 by the drummer, who's sound was unique to the time. Its not dark metal, and its not Nine Inch Nails style either. A very nice, "in between", with a garage band feel.Practically self-produced, the band needed a bit of sound balancing and equalization. The guitars overpower the vocalist and drummer a bit, but you still get what he's saying. It could be the copy I received from the band directly.The lyrics are very heavy and not for those looking for that, "love rock". In fact, those who want to be mad, GET THIS ALBUM.I noticed they forgot the explicit lyrics warning label, yeah, not for kids.
__label__1 Terrible!: I wrote a bad review of this book 2 years ago, and can not find it here... it is one of the WORST reference books I have seen. I ended up selling mine as "used" here on Amazon! The glowing reviews must be from spam-reviewers or students/people who just don't use C++ except as a better C. C++ it large and complex, and only a fraction of it is covered in this "reference". Today I found "C++ In a Nutshell" which is finally the real C++ Reference. Ignore all others. (I do like Shildt's Java books, this is bad editing, formatting, or a half-hearted effort.)
__label__2 Essential for every runner...: ...who does not:1. Have a pocket for keys in his shorts,2. Like using the small key pocket that many running shorts have---I hate feeling it flap around while I jog3. Like wearing his keys on his neck, wrist, or waistband4. Mind having a slightly unsightly add-on on the top of his shoes5. Mind the added difficulty of tightening/loosening his shoelaces with this shoe pocket thingy strapped in between the laces6. Want to wear a wrist wallet (fear of tan lines, physical discomfort, etc.)7. Mind paying a rather ridiculous price for something that, if Walmart carried it, would probably cost 1/3 as much and still provide them with a respectable retail profit.
__label__1 what you want is the fourth edition: I'm sure this book was great in the 90s, but this is the 21st century, when you can buy the fourth edition. There has been a ton of advancement between 1994 and 2002.
__label__1 Should have passed this one by: I bought this book while visiting the Yorkshire Dales, after lapping up the James Herriot series years earlier. I was sooo excited to find the book and had romantic visions of reading about the real James Herriot while visiting his homeland.Ohhhhh, how I wish I had picked up the book, soaked up the photos, and put the book right back on the shelf.A classic case of raining on my parade; bursting my bubble; toss out ANY fitting cliche. It shattered all my illusions about James Harriet's life, experiences, and loved ones. If you are a sentimental fool like me and have read Herriot's books, pass this one byyyyy.
__label__1 Long and Drawn out: I love to read gossipy, Hollywood type books. I just could not get into this one. I found myself continuosly going back to the jacket to remember what I was suppose to be reading about. I finished only because I hate to buy a book and not finish it. The character, Alex, complains then complains again. O.K. now what, start a plot already. About halfway the plot visualizes and it's not that bad after that. I would not reccomend this book if you are looking for excitement throughout.
__label__1 Just an unrealistic shoot 'em up with no little plot exploration and character development: Fight scenes are more unbelievable than a Steven Segal film. Characters are left undeveloped, serving simply as people to fire bullets as zombies. Plot is predictable. Essentially, it feels like a video game--but it's supposed to be a movie.
__label__1 I wish we could rate on a scale of 0 to 5...: ...because I would definitely give it a 0. Please, please, do NOT buy this printer. It has been way more trouble than it is worth and after reading all of the other testimonies I'm even more frustrated. I too have had my Epson CX 5400 for a year and started having problems with it when I changed 3 of the ink cartridges. I've tried countless head cleanings and nozzle checks and have been repeatedly left with essentially blank pages (the little black dots that do appear are such a tease). I guess I'm another victim of clogged nozzle heads. Not even going to bother with the technical support...everyone else's reviews have me convinced that it is a complete waste of time and money. Curse you Epson!
__label__1 Boring junior high school level book.: All the chapters constantly drag on and on like a boring novel. The book is somewhat like a director trying to strech a 50 minute movie into a 2 hour epic. There are few terms in bold and tons of useless garbage in between that is just opinions and junk you don't need to know. This book is more like the type of book you will find in junior high school levels. Like a mother talking to a child type of writing quality. There are many other outstanding books on the market. Don't waste your time purchasing this book. Anyway, this is a school textbook, not a reference book that you would keep at your workstation or library. Why would you buy a textbook and not a "computer" type of book. How can this be a second edition? Many typos have not been edited.
__label__1 Mos and Kweli: I would point the potential purchaser of this album in the direction of Blackstar, and Internal Affairs, The album would have done well to include more Monch and Kweli, in fact seeing as how Mos, Kweli, Monch, and MOP are the only good rappers to even appear on the album I wouldn't even bother Buying the compilation
__label__2 explorist 210: Not a bad unit for the price. This is a replacement for a different model that was damaged. More memory, plus USB cable. You can only move files from computer to unit and back, though. I was thinking when I bought it the unit would work 'real time' with the computer for navigation, but it won't. You can, however, set up a route using the software and transfer it to the unit if you want to preplan a route, or transfer your trail to the computer.
__label__1 new adaptation of accepted product: The original Hydroxycut worked very well till the Feds had them take the guts out of it. Since then, Muscle Tech has been playing around with various replacements (and levels of caffeine). I have used several of these products, and have been generally satisfied with the results (stacking with other products, it should be noted). This version "hardcore elite" is the first to actually keep me up at night if I take it after 3 or 4 pm, leading me to believe the caffeine or related product is on time release delayed that long. I'm no expert, but simply my own empirical experience has me preferring previous Hydroxycut products more.
__label__1 unusable with garage band: Using the firewire input I ALWAYS get popping on any of the MIC inputs. The popping is variable and it may have something to do with the driver software, but I have been unable to isolate the cause. Ive swapped cables and went back to using my ONYX 8. while the NRV 10 is lauded as a great live mixer it is UNUSABLE with garage band OSX 10.6.8 if you are using the firewire input. Would change this review is I can resolve this issue
__label__2 In Love...no better prenatal: I love this vitamin! If you have trouble swallowing horse pill sized prenatal vitamins while you are pregnant, this is perfect. It is green in color and that could be a turnoff to some. It is a little grainy in texture and very sweet tasting. It's like a green, sugary, grainy syrup. I do double shots of this when it's cold and flu season and I stay healthy. My husband noticed I never get sick anymore and asked my secret, when I told him it was my vitamins, he started taking daily shots too. I use this before, during, and after pregnancy. I wish I knew about this product earlier. I would have taken my vitamins more consistently with a previous pregnancy.
__label__1 Immediatly broke: This watch immediatly broke I give 1 star. What a waste of money! I gave it to my dog. It was not waterproof took it for a swim. borken bad horrble rip off
__label__1 Short lived batteries: I purchased a S100 about 2 years ago and also an extra battery. After taking several thousand photos, these batteries are toast! Starting fully charged, it seems the "low power" icon now blinks on after taking only a few photos. Charging also seems way too fast, under a half hour (and it makes no difference even if I charge them overnight). I am looking for replacements, but Amazon doesn't seem to sell these any more. I suppose it's possible my charger is to blame, but these batteries don't last long under heavy use in my experience.
__label__1 Not worth the money: The towels are okay but the logos are a VERY flimsy decal that will peel or wear off with even light use. These towels are for decorative use only.
__label__2 Celine the Finest Extract of 90's Pop: 90's music will be remembered by excellent female vocalists such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. Celine is a versatile Canadian singer who can sing Broadway musical styled Beauty and Beast rock songs such as All By Myself (Eric Carmen cover) and It's All Coming Back To Me Now (my #1 favorite Celine song) and groovy Because You Loved Me. Personally I would like to hear more of rocky-edged songs but her dynamic vocal appeal is irresistible. Unlike any other compilations this has seven newer tracks including That's The Way It Is featured as single. This latter part of this compilation is somewhat similar in softer tone with latest A New Day Has Come. I am really glad that she came back and will enchant us for sure during this decade as well.
__label__1 Book was better: I have read 1984 the book several times and I just finished watching the movie. In my opinion the movie left much to be desired. At least it didn't gang-rape the book -- it followed the plot and even the ending -- but the movie left too many things out and I get the impression that unless you've read the book you wouldn't be able to understand it. You can't really make a decent movie out of 1984 anyway. I do like the movie for being able to capture the setting of Oceania so well, though, that's why I give it two stars not one.
__label__2 Psychic guidance for everyone!: I continue to be amazed at both the accuracy and consistency of the Archangel Oracle Cards. Anyone, regardless of psychic ability, will receive guidance through these cards, provided one is sincere in their desire to receive guidance, and willing to accept and act upon that guidance ... quite simply ... AMAZING!
__label__2 One really great album: This was one of my first albums when I was 8 years old and I instantly became a fan. Now at the ripe age of mid twenties I still listen to her. And with a remasted cd including 3 live songs that propel her voice. Well this a a win win situation.
__label__1 Early failure for no apparent reason: Mine failed, for no apparent reason, within 2 months of when I bought it. I couldn't bring it back to life. Other than that, it was fine.
__label__1 a screen reader inaccessible to the blind: What were they thinking? One of the main points of Kindle is to make books accessible by sound rather than sight, right? Then why is it that the controls needed to accomplish this task require use of vision? An electronic reading device that requires vision is like a wheelchair lift that has controls six feet off the ground.
__label__2 Big Laughs from Gentle Jabs: I bought this in an airport and read it from cover to cover on the flight...I laughed so loud and so hard that the guy across the aisle finally leaned over and said, "WHAT are you reading?" Bill Bryson pokes fun (gently) at an America he has recently rediscovered.
__label__2 I liked it...: I really enjoyed this movie. My family hated it. I thought it was quirky and fun and a pleasure to go along for the ride. The different personalities of the band members and the small townspeople were universally recognizable. Very human. I really liked it. Not for everyone.
__label__2 Excellent disc! Buy it.: Very entertaining. Captures Rush very well. Sound QUALITY is Excellent. MIX is not but live shows are hard to get perfect. Geddy's Vocals ARE a little back or down in the mix but that is the only flaw I can find. Second disc is fun, great to see the guys being themselves. Multi angle was fun.
__label__2 a must read: i first read this book and high school and it had a profound effect on me emotionally and spiritually. this is a great book because it opens you up to the spiritual world and of a timeless and repeated story of the development of a young man.
__label__2 Bissell Spot Bot: Loved it!!! It is incredibly easy and effective to use!I have a couple of old cats who don't always "keep their food down" Now I don't have to be scrubbing out the stains on my hands and knees anymore!G. Mallard
__label__1 This book does not adequately explain its concepts: This book does not adequately explain the concepts of multivariable calculus. The ideas and concepts presented in each section often do not provide the reader w/ enough to solve the excercise problems, even with the example problems included. I would not have bought this book if it had not been mandatory for a class I took at Baylor University.
__label__1 Don't take it all at face value: Epidemiological narratives are fascinating, but loaded with judgments.In this book, Shilts shows off a lot of research plus storytelling skills. It's trying to be quite comprehensive, but there's a lot more to say about the subject.I recommend reading Paula Treichler's "How to Have Theory in an Epidemic: Cultural Chronicles of AIDS (Series Q)"Paul Farmer's writings on HIV and blame are definitely worth reading (I don't believe Farmer ever writes about the book or movie of "And the Band..." but he's a great writer).AIDS and Accusation: Haiti and the Geography of BlameAnd I believe Simon Watney's "Practices of Freedom: Selected Writings on HIV/AIDS (Series Q)", a collection of essays, responds directly to Randy Shilts' book and criticizes it for the weight (and blame) placed on Shilts' "Patient Zero" character. These are all good perspectives to add if you're interested in policy, theory or social meaning around HIV/AIDS.
__label__2 Excellent lightweight field-guide: An amazing amount of useful information packed into a booklet not much bigger than the average camera manual.This is one book that is to be found permanently stashed in my camera bag while out in the African bushveld.Particularly noteworthy are the chapters dealing with lenses, exposure, film types and composition. When in the field, I find myself often referring to the chapter on exposure, which is one of the clearest most concise expositions I have ever seen on the subject.
__label__2 What a change - Jack just plays...: No singing on this album. The entire album is filled with what Jack does best: wail on his trumpet. Excellent combo performances, from soulful ballads to jazzy uptempo tunes. Jack is at the top of his game on this album. Jerry Dodgion assists on alto, along with Barry Harris on piano, Rufus Reid on bass, and Ben Riley on drums. 13 tracks and over 63 minutes of super mainstream jazz. Play on, Mr. Sheldon!
__label__1 Accurate tracking, terrible scrolling: After receiving this mouse, I plugged it directly into my computer and everything worked perfectly. The tracking was incomparably good to my previous Microsoft wireless optical mouse. The scrolling (vertical and horizontal) was good until about a month later when it felt as if something fell out or became dislodged. When this happened, vertical scrolling was practically impossible as sometimes when you scroll up it would go down and vice versa. Editing large images in Photoshop as well as switching weapons in FPSs is a pain.
__label__2 Some dry - er, wet - British humor for your amusement: "Flushed Away" is a light but entertaining animated adventure set in a surprisngly antiseptic version of the London sewers. Top-notch visuals and endless sight gags save a fairly thin and predictable story line (think "The African Queen" crossed with "Romancing The Stone," and with gender roles reversed). Not as charming as "Curse of the Were-Rabbit," but passable entertainment for kids and parents alike.
__label__1 Unresponsive Buttons: We've had this timer for about five years and I am on Amazon now shopping for a new one. We've liked the styling and functionality of this timer's various features and modes, but it has one fatal flaw: the buttons often do not respond to your touch, requiring two or three pushes of the button for a response. Perhaps this design flaw has been fixed on newer models, but on our timer, every single button requires the user to be extra vigilant and diligent about making sure your button-push 'took.' It's especially hard to get the timer to respond when you have to push TWO buttons simultaneously, as when you are clearing the previous time in the 'stopwatch' mode.I don't mind having to fiddle with this timer when I have the time, but on some critical applications where seconds count (film development in days of yore), this is not the timer you want to be using.
__label__1 Disappointment: I should have listened to other reviewers. It looked so funny when we saw it on America's Funniest Videos that we couldn't resist trying it for ourselves. We were prepared with duct tape to re-enforce the suction cups, but it wasn't enough.It was a disappointment and earned the remark, "Was this supposed to be funny?":C
__label__2 This album did it for me!: Being up in Canada we havent had alot of exposure to Savatage, this is the first of their music I had ever heard. I am a huge fan of Judas Priest and had heard that this was one of Rob Halfords favourite bands so I bought a Savatage disc at a yard sale. It was Edge of Thorns, and I have been a fan ever since. Every track on this disc is outstanding. Because of this album I have had to buy every bit of their music I could find. this is one of the best discs in the world period..
__label__1 Only able to rate "half" of the order: The problem is that, after repeated messaging, importcds still only fulfilled the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER portion of this "Double Feature." The quality of the former is excellent and worth the price were it the ONLY offering. However, I expect orders to be fulfilled as promised.
__label__2 Good for Reasearch: This book has helped me give many reports on the subject of media violence. Stories from the book shocked me of how the media can influence peoples lives. I was really shocked about the story on the "The Program" how a kid actually lied on the middle highway line with oncoming traffic. Its a shame how he died doing that stupid stunt from the movie.
__label__2 Definitely pleased: The first thing I want to say is that I got this DVD 4 days earlier than expected, so that was very awesome. That's the fastest I've ever gotten anything from ordering something online.Secondly, as a 23 year old person, it's surprising how great this show is. I remember loving it as a kid, but I totally forgot how great it really is.
__label__1 pisspoor ghostwriting: Evidently Noon has a ghost writer. Vurt was good, wonderful, beautiful. Had Noon actually *written* Vurt, we would be gifted with a canonical author of science fiction in an era when syndicate ties can win one author dozens of hugos and nebulas, where sexual proclivity and race can close another author out of all but a very few.Sadly, Pollen was a struggle to read and probably just as damnably difficult to write without the assistance of the unseen scribbler of Vurt, very possibly the same ghost writer who handled the Dead Girls series purportedly by Calder.Automated Alice was hardly interesting in any avenue that Noon could have manuevered her. She is a dreadful bore: nothing in her sparkles with the wit of a creator of Vurt.It might become a truism that nothing fascinating shall again descend from our noonsong.
__label__1 waste of money: It is just a fake, or something really bad has happen to invicta, cause it isn't what it used to be. Maybe looks fine, but the mechanics is terrible, the date changed every 12 hours and the hand got loose (minutes) only 3 weeks after I bought it. My old ugly Casio runs smoothly after 12 years. Run and seek for another option, maybe a Citizen. You'll thank me later.
__label__1 Difficulties: Was unable to load it into my computer, even with help. As a result it is useless. The manufacturer no longer supports it.
__label__1 Aggressively biased, but needs to be objectively critiqued: This work must be intellectually assailed within the context in which it is presented. Religious emotionalism should not be a factor in a balanced criticism. Each section of the book should be placed in a historical, cultural, and pychological framework. Bertrand Russell wrote a book about why he was not a Christian; understandably so because he was an atheist--still his position is still studied, by those who desperately desire not to become anti-Christian. The same degree of study should apply here; study what he has to say, critique each aspect with somber documentation and let the evidence fall where it may. No book should be condemned(burned) because it affronts our sensibilities. Allah is the best Knower. Allah has a plan, Shaitan(Devil) has a plan, but Allah is the Greatest of Planners
__label__1 Not at all durable.: This thing is a blast and my German Shepherd really loves how it flies. It almost hovers sometimes... she could catch it 9/10 throws. Lots of fun.But... it falls apart. I didn't ever let Juno chew this thing, it was a fetch-only toy. She is an aggressive frisbee catcher, I guess, often snapping them out of the air or pouncing on it as it tumbles through its landing. Anyhow, it's weak around the 'feet' and that is where the first tear happened. From there, a similar tear afflicted the other 3 feet and eventually the feet were nearly coming off, exposing the tubes inside. Eventually one section of tube worked itself out of the fabric. It still flies as of today, but it's about 8 or 9 days old. Not exactly an economical choice. I'd recommend this if your dog doesn't actually catch the frisbee... or is extremely gentle with it when it does. Great idea, just not durable enough.
__label__2 I'm sorry it's over...: I've never written a review, but I was completely touched by this book. Marian Keyes is an expert at balancing serious issues with endearing characters (okay, there are also some despicable characters) in real-life contexts. I love the fact that this book was long; I was totally torn between not wanting it to be over and yet, desperately needing to find out what happens.Do not hesitate about making this purchase! I am sad I only have two more of her books left to read.
__label__2 fabulous resource: This is a fabulous book, whether you are interested in Sumter County history or not. The stories are interesting, the information is helpful, and the topics are diverse. The real extra value is the explanation of WHY things were happening. This is not your standard chest-thumping local history, but includes a thought provoking explanation of the dynamic Southern mores. It is easy to be judgemental from the distance of time, but it is another to see the evolution of certain practices and habits. It opened my eyes to a whole other level of understanding of Southern history. A wonderful book!
__label__2 Funny!: I was excited to see that Amazon still carried this movie. Although its old, its highly underated. With Tommy Davidson's comedic talent and Jada's sassy attitude - makes the movie funnier and funnier as the minutes roll...you need a good laugh...check Woo out!
__label__2 Excellent CD, great feeling, needs more acoustic: I had no idea how popular Dashboard Confessional had made themselves with their MTV appearances and their gush-worthy sensitive bad boy leader, Chris Carrabba until I went to buy this and saw the huge display in the music store. Wow, when did they become mainstream? That's okay, the sound is still very heartfelt, with great instrumentation but most importantly, Carrabba's great vocals. I like my MTV Unplugged disk better, and the emotion comes through better with acoustics, but this is still an excellent release. They deserve all the attention they're getting, I just hope it doesn't go to their heads.
__label__1 Not hot enough!: I loved my old George Foreman grill but hated cleaning it. When this one came out with the removable plates I ran out and bought it. What a disappointment! This new one has temperature control (unlike my old model which was either "on" or "off") and the highest setting is 425 degrees. Apparently this just isn't hot enough. As another reviewer said, the food doesn't grill, it steams!If you like grey, tasteless hamburgers, then this is the appliance you want. As for me, I'm gonna go dig my old GF grill out of the charity box in the garage.
__label__1 Really?: I have simply this to say about this book: Go elsewhere. The mere fact that the title includes 'rastafarianism' should be a large red flag. There are no 'ism's in Rastafari. Go back type 'rastafari' in the search bar and buy the first book by Barry Chevannes.Wesley
__label__1 Short, but very true&#65533;: Maya's a member of a middle-school clique, until one day, when their "leader" decides to ditch her. Maya's confusion, along with three of the other girls in the clique's emotions are explored in short chapters that switch back and forth from one girl to another. What emerges is a sad, but very true picture of how cliques function and how girls treat their "friends." My main gripe with this book was that it was far too short and read more like a short story than a novel. I wish that the characters had been expanded a bit more, but maybe by keeping it short, the author was trying to prove a point.
__label__2 H&B Cup mute: A lot of more expensive mutes out there, but I still like the sound of this one, especially once I file down the corks a little bit and line the inside of the cup with felt, better than any other one I've ever used. Got this one for a friend to use, as I still have mine from probably 15 years ago.
__label__1 How about specs we can use!: Was going to order, but didn't know if it would fit my TV. Called Amazon, after multiple holds, they couldn't come up with telephone # for Vogel. Why not state under 'more technical data' what VESA means! The holes in back of my TV are approx. 4" X 8",apart (rectangular). Is it that difficult to add some useful specs?
__label__2 slow music & slow sex: I especially enjoyed the chapters on slow music and slow loving. As a musician, I often play pieces more slowly than the composer intended. Or, I alter the notes, or improvise a coda.If you are interested in slow lovin', island style, check out Slow Love: A Polyneaian Pillow Book.Slow Love: A Polynesian Pillow Book
__label__1 Handloading for Competition Making the Target Bigger.: Zediker praises Dillion and Lee products to much and I prefer RCBS and Redding. Just a matter of opinion! He did have some things of interest but alot I already knew!
__label__2 Excellent: I used this book for my XHTML class and the exercises were fantastic. Conformed with HTML 4 and XHTML 1.1 standards, and showed validation for all "flavors".
__label__2 An all in one console: When I first heard about the Sega Dreamcast I thought it was a waste of money. I thought that it's graphics were just a little better than the n64, but it turns out that the graphics are quite a bit better. It's not only a good video game machine it can also play music cds. The part that impressed me the most was that the Dreamcast is capible of surfing the internet and it surfs it pretty fast with a 56k modem built into the console. I would say that Dreamcast is a must have for people that want an all in one console.
__label__2 Great lens: Great lens, gives me more opportunities to work with light on my terms. Product arrived without delay. Great service!
__label__1 Great height, easy use, not strong enough.: The extra tall gate was perfect height for my 2 yr old who is 36". She broke it within a months time, by banging and pulling on it. The latch could not withstand her strength. I also didn't find it secured well enough since it does not have the capacity to be bolted into the wall. At the time it cost us $70, and I was unable to contact anyone from the company for a replacement or refund. (We had thrown away the box!)
__label__2 Small and convenient: The size of the product make it convenient. The communication is clear. After a while, I have headache using it!
__label__2 Great book: I am a financial advisor and I frequently loan this book to clients and they usually love it. Its also a great book to give to young people. It really gets across the message that you don't have to make a lot of money to be wealthy, you just have to live below your means and invest well. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Good book for anyone: I was really impressed by the textbook. It is layed out in a clean and logical manner, the illustrations really make defining characteristics clear, and it's interesting reading. I'm a practicing blood banker but this book I'm keeping!
__label__1 The media is right: Ann Coulter persuasively demonstrates that the mainstream media is well to the left of George W. Bush (Thank God), and that conservatives as a group have no sense of humour. Not news. The book is filled out with virulent rhetoric attacking anyone to the left of Genghis Khan. Nowhere does it attempt to defend Bush's indefensibly atrocious domestic and international policy that is making a laughingstock of the world's most powerful (and dangerous) country.A complete waste of time.
__label__1 I don't entirely disagree with her views, but....: When I turn on the TV and this sneering, snarling harpy is on yet another news debate show, I change the station immediately. Or not....it's like a train wreck. You can't look away.This woman's arguments are PERSONAL. I have no idea why.And Ann.....ditch the Veronica Lake look, already.
__label__1 Piece of ....: Got this thing for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. Hooked everything up Christmas eve, she was so excited, then the DVD player didn't work. Won't read DVD's or CD's. Thanks for ruining her Christmas KLH! That is why I buy Sony only...learned my lesson on this one.
__label__2 Exposing Satan's Subtle Perversion of the Scriptures: This is a must read for Christians. It exhaustively exposes the attempt of the New Age scribes to pervert the Holy Scriptures with new Bible versions such as the NIV, NASB, Living, etc. If you have intertained the idea of using some of the modern Bible translations other than the Authorized King James Version, please read this book first. What a blessing this work is.
__label__1 Made in China - NOT worth the risk: While these seems tasty and have a good texture, they are made in China. Despite what the manufacturer or anyone else says, while I might let my child play with a toy or wear clothes made in China, I would not let my child ingest any food made in China. My colleagues at work have visited with manufacturers of all types of products in China (including food) and based on what I have heard from their first hand accounts as well as the known incidents such as melamine milk, I would not let my baby put food made in China is his mouth. Sorry, not worth the risk in my opinion.
__label__1 Abysmal: Poorly acted. Poorly executed. Good idea. Zero character development. The story line is disjointed and does not flow. It appears the director tried to emulate Peter Jackson, but fell short.
__label__1 I gave up: I had the feeling there must be some suplimentary material I was missing while trying to read this book. Alot of ideas that had no explanation. Basically I gave up trying make use of this book.It has some of the usual stuff included in books on this subject, like instrument ranges. For me, there were just too many ideas without a clue as to HOW to do it. You might as well say "try to make good sounding songs" "try to keep your melodies interesting" "use discipline, and good judgment in your arrangment". If you are a fan of this style of advice and teaching, then you will love this book.
__label__1 a flop: I was disappointed in the purchase. At first, I thought what great deal to have two for such a great price. Installing the screen was a different matter. I have larger windows in the back and it doesn't cover the entire window. Also because of a slight curvature in the window - the suction cup doesn't stick to the window on the bottom. The velco on the bottom is not an option for me. It still hangs there, but will need to find a better solution when he is no longer in his infant carrier with the canopy to cover from the sun.
__label__1 Kid's hat a so-so product: Hat is one size - not adjustable. Tight fit fir an 8-year old girl. I would recommend looking for an adjustable size hat.
__label__2 Packed Well, Made Well, Reasonably Priced: The packaging was done right with substantial bubble wrap and cardboard to ensure minimal damage. The frame is wood and not a cheap plastic or metal design with actual glass. In addition, the clasps and triangle eye mounts in the back create a snug fit and provide sufficient mounting options.
__label__1 Lousy product: You almost never get a clean signal and unless you have a full time assistant constantly changing radio stations for you and reading the almost unreadable digital display, it's dangerous to use this product and drive. Don't buy it.
__label__1 This author is into himself..minimal public offering.: If Baldner wasn't such a self serving egotist, the assumption that a subject was being presented may have played out. The author is truly impressed with himself.
__label__2 Finally n instrumental version on a commercial release!: It's quite rare now to find on commercial releases "instrumental" versions, that's just one of the reasons to get this single. Resta In Ascolto Instrumental version gives you another perspective of the song. Beside you can get on the same CD the spanish and Italian version of this amazing song
__label__2 Great Bread for our Celiac Family: Our entire family of 5 really loves this bread and guests have as well. It is holds up well for GF overnight french toast! Add a little vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, and extra sugar to the recipe for a yummy treat. For some reason the mix overflows my bread machine pan so I have to watch it and scoop some out while it's rising. This never happened when I used to make gluten bread in the machine.
__label__2 Excellent How-To Bead Book: This is a fablulous how-to book whether you are just starting out or an experienced beader. After reading the Basics you cannot help but make something in this book. The ideas are extremely unique and *hip*. I am in the process of making the Found Objects Charm bracelet and it is fun. Every charm tells a story and is a part of history in my life. As always, I love your ideas, Katie!
__label__1 As usual, Hef and Co. fail to deliver: Playboy's latest shameless attempt to cash in on the current explosion of lesbian erotica contains, what a surprise, little to no erotica, just like the Girlfriends series. If Playboy actually produced a video with entirely new footage of this kind, in which they expanded their boundaries somewhat (could we at least see girls KISS?), and starred predominantly playmates, it might be worth it, but this pretty much sucks. As enticing as the title sounds, don't buy it; it's just recycled crap which is very far from erotic, except for one or two sequences. Trust me.
__label__1 Not for the casual military history reader: I would not recommend this book to the casual reader of military history. It doesn't take long after diving into this tome to become completely bogged down in stats, unit numbers, unfamiliar geography and confusing tactics. This would be a good book for the very serious student of the SS. Anyone who loves the writing styles of say Stephen Ambrose or Antony Beever will be very disappointed with this book and will find yourself heading back to the bookstore or post office to return it for a refund or something more readable or understandable to the average reader of military history.
__label__2 Kids loved it!: Very action oriented book! Lots of Kung Fu, a little bit of blood and gore, bit of fantasy (animals behaving in sympathy with humans) a litte (not too accurate) culture thrown in, definitely some mystery and good vs. evil. My 10 year old read it and REALLY loved it...he can't wait for the next book to come out. Consider that very sensitive children might be bothered by multiple deaths and violence. Resistent readers may be inspired by this book with very appealing characters and a clear sense of conflict re: obeying, thinking for oneself, appropriate use of violence.
__label__2 Better than expected: I have never owned a GPS unit to use during our workouts, so I did not know what to expect. But, this a very nice little gadget. Because I have not delved into many of the features it has, I gave it four stars, but for length of skate/bike/run, pace and time, it is easy to read, far more accurate than I expected and has allowed us to prepare much better for our inline marathons. The price is where it gets really good. I talked to several people who paid much more for their GPS units and found they liked this one as much or better. I am quite sure several people I have loaned this unit, will be purchasing one very soon.
__label__1 Disappointing quality: While this is widely recognized as a superb concert movie, the quality of this DVD is very poor. The picture's not great. The sound is appalling.
__label__1 The worst baterie for game boy ever: It is a terrible product.It get's memory easy.Memory is when it thinks it's charged but really isn't.It is also a wierd shape.If you ask me get a shock "n" rock. I wrote a a good review on it.
__label__1 Constant buzzing: I ordered this product inspight of reading reviews that stated it was not worth it. I won't do that again. There was a constant buzzing that could be heard on both ends. I needed this for working. It's a defective product.
__label__2 This One Is a Winner!: Excellent HD video and production. Audio better than average. Interesting wide variety and varied locations. Not just a screen saver or stationary camera. We will definitely try more Blu-ray products from HD Scape.
__label__1 Flimsy Knife: I ordered this because I wanted a good knife prop for a short film that was in production at the time. I thought it would be sturdy but would bend if I made it bend. When I received it, I was very disappointed. It was very flimsy and would look extremely unrealistic in the short film (not saying that my film was realistic towards its intention at all) and I ended up writing the fight scene with the knife out. I might have gotten a defective toy, but I was disappointed with what I got. I believe it's intention was for a young child's Halloween costume.
__label__2 Son loves this!: My son and his friends sit around and record or make music, and he has no problems with this at all! He would buy it again!
__label__2 Goofy fun. I loved it!!!: I'm a single guy that got the book because I wanted to see why a "sports guy" with ESPN credentials would write about a topic like romance. Not only did it prepare me for what to expect from my future wife, but it showed me the true meaning of self-deprication. Joe not only rips himself throughout the book on his parenting and romance skills, but gives readers the inside track on how to improve both. Women will love it because it's all about them. Men will hate it, but will find many things in common with Joe, especially when it comes to helping out around the house. I recommend it highly for those who are married, single or divorced.
__label__2 The second coming: The final scene of the movie belies the rest of the movie. Suppose the final scene denotes truly what Chauncy Gardner was. Then all that went before was truly profound and not the ramblings of a mentally challenged person.There was no identification associated with Chauncy, maybe he did just appear. Maybe heaven sent.
__label__2 Much better than book 1and 2!: When I got this book I thought it was going to be like the last two. I was wrong; this book is more entertaining and exciting then the last two.Grubbs Grady is trying to get his life on track after saving his brother from turning into a werewolf. His uncle Dervish is almost back to normal after fighting lord loss. In this book Dervish is called to do a movie with a famous horror director. It turns out it is a trap set by lord loss. I can't believe that Dervish and Grubbs escaped from the grasps of lord loss for the second time in a row but in return many civilians were slaughtered.This book is a great book for young adults, but I am not sure about children because there is a lot of graphic violence. I can't wait until Darren Shaw comes out with the fourth book Bec.
__label__2 New Yogi: Judith Lasater's book is about the type of yoga I was longing for, so I bought the book and commenced to teach myself. Restorative yoga is a wonderful art and Lasater's book covers the practice in the most thorough comprehensive way. There are suggestions for creating your own props from household blankets, pillows, etc. pictures, cautions, benefits. A treasure. Even better, I have since found a studio that offers this type of yoga on a regular basis, and my book is always here forfurther learning, enjoyment, and reference. One of my best purchases from Amazon.
__label__1 Pasion De Gavilanes: I am so very disappointed. I was about to purchase Pasion de Gavilanes but I am glad I read the reviews. I don't understand why not sell the "Novela"in full in the DVD version! That shows very little respect for the public. Thank you for the alert!
__label__1 Terrible design: The wire binding the pages together has a large gap in the center, with the gap placed inward, toward the pages so that the pages are constantly coming out of the wire binding. Whoever designed this thing was a moron.
__label__1 Too little too late: I once got hit by a huge ship in the middle of Puget Sound. No one ever once mentioned shipping lanes. Damn. I sure wish I'd known about this book back then. But even then, it doesn't really explain the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the huge ship capital of the Northwest. So please I beg you! Stay away from the Strait!
__label__1 Where do I begin...: I have read every book in this series and was waiting for the 5 book. I was excited...now I'm disapponted...and my wallet is 40 bucks lighter. This book could have been 400 pages shorter if they cut out all of the ers, mms, and hmmms. Come on. I'm 15 and i don't mumble and crap myself when I talk to a girl. Voldemort's "plan" was mediocore at best and I'm still trying to find out what the point of this book was. Besides to kill off the only good charecter. All in all this book ranks way up there with Robert Jordan's recent work. If you want to read it I'ld have to say check it out of the library or wait for the paper back version. Maybe by that time they would have edited it.
__label__2 Amazing Show: McGee and Me is an excellent series. My only regret is that Focus on the Family didn't make more of these. The animation portion is very well done - much better than most current animation that I've seen. The actors were well chosen - especially the main character, "Nick". And not only is this series entertaining, but inspirational as well.
__label__2 Awesome.: For the beginner, tryD.960 - Mvt 1 (Simple, yet poignant and deep)D.959 - Mvt 2 (A rollercoaster of emotions)D.894 - Mvt 1 (I imagine myself wandering through fog)
__label__1 Poorly Made: We bought this for Christmas. Here we are 3 days later and it isn't really played with even though this was my daughter's most desired item. All of the snap in pieces fall off when barely touches. The crown won't stay together. The elevator is nearly impossible, even for me, to raise and lower. I read other reviews about supergluing the pieces together so I will be doing that so she can play with it.
__label__1 Silently so-so: Not so impressed after using it to strip old millwork with intricate detail. It worked great on flat areas, but did more harm than good on the details - paint was hard to remove from crevices, and then would dry hard and crusty and uneven as soon as you remove the heat to use both hands to get into the details, and made sanding even more difficult than if i had just left it alone. When I tried to go back and re-work an area, the exposed wood burned because there was no longer an even coat of paint to protect it from the heat. Some of the detailing I was removing paint from turned out not to be wood, and created damage by melting it. Gets really heavy to hold too, and hot! So hot in fact that it cracked a mirror. If I had to do it again, would use a non-toxic chemical based stripper instead.
__label__1 Terrible: I got this today from Wholefood based on all reviews. It is very weak. No tea flavor watery, Worst decaf tea I have tasted. Even Tetley decaf is better.The best decaf tea is Barry'sDoes not deserve any star.
__label__1 I was expecting something else: That video didn't do it for me. I found the subject was treated in a shallow way and I was expecting a little more depth.Suzanne
__label__2 MACABRE, INTRIGUING, HUMOROUS: Having a fetish for words beginning with "D", Jeff Lindsay has written another daring installment featuring his serial killer non-pareil, Dexter Morgan, a killer with a conscience and a goal. His designated targets are those who deserve the wrath of society, and it's a feel-good moment when he catches up with the dastardly demons to give them their just desserts. Dexter has an abiding sense of humor along with his warped sense of decency. Coupling the unique situation with this sadistic character results in some hilarious lines filled with imaginative irony.At a meet-the-author event Lindsey disclosed that he researched the novel located in Miami so that details, such as how long it takes to get from one destination to another driving the speed his characters would be driving, are accurate. The set is real; it was a little chilling to discover one of the killers lived on the same street I'd lived on.
__label__2 Good: So far I haven't noticed any damage to the book. I did see highlights on the pages that i actually wasn't expecting. I have been reading it and there aren't any pages missing.
__label__2 Every song is great!: I have just recently discovered Lee Roy....Wow! This CD takes you all over the place....from country to gospel to southern rock. His voice is rich..his stories great and his guitar just carries it all along. Sit back, listen and see what you think.
__label__2 Musiq Soulchild: This album is tight!!! I got a copy off a female friend and I just popped the CD in, couldn't stop listening to it. Had to get a copy. Lyrics are tight, jazzy, soulfull, mellow. Definitely, philly inspired. No doubt, there are influences of D'Angelo and Stevie, but I believe Musiq has his own originality. Favorite track is 'Seventeen' (#10)!! Nomination for a Grammy please!!!!
__label__2 Captivating Story: The cast in this story does a credible job in pulling off this story. I liked the casting except for the part of Mr. Thorpe. He did not at all match the beauty of his sister. However, I would have given this product five stars had it not been for the gratuitous sexual overtones in Miss Morland's dream scene and Captain Tilney's one-night stand with Miss Thorpe. These were not necessary and would have saved us the trouble of skipping over these parts each time we view the movie. Mr. Tilney, Miss Morland, Miss Tilney and General Tilney were all portrayed very well. The story is very well done and is entertaining.
__label__2 Blind Dogs: The book has brought some understanding of how to live with a blind dog. It has some great ideas that you would not think of. Our pet will be happier because of the read. The book was shipped fast and with no defects.
__label__1 heavy book to hold down recylcing container: Given this book as a gift, and unfortunately it is of little use to me. I already know how to cook real whole foods, exercise, and do not need inspiration for baby steps into healthy living. These books are all the same, written for people looking for someone else to tell them what to eat and live forever, without much mental or physical effort, while only ever going halfway so as not to alienate potential buyers/readers. Recycling bin here we come.
__label__1 Sloppy sentimentality: Sloppy sentimentality is the essence of this badly written first novel. The protagonist is a bundle of self-conscious sensitivity, a man of shallow sentiments and saccarine emotions. It's no wonder his sweetheart choses to sleep with another man. Janey is a modern day Margaret O'Brien, all sweetness and light. The aw shucks residents of Linden Corners seem to be taken from some bucolic utopia as seen in bad TV. The dialog is unbelievably wooden, frought with cliched adolescent phrases and cutesy nicknames. Surprisingly, since the novel is set in the historic and beautiful Hudson Valley, there is no sense of place, no individuality of scene except for an out-of-place windmill; Linden Corners is indistinguishable from Green Acres. The plot is predictable, padded with redundant sentimental events, leading to the enevitable, and welcomed, tragic conclusion. Read this novel at your peril.
__label__2 Wasn't disappointed!: After reading some of the negative reviews and still deciding to order these slim cases, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package (which arrived on schedule and without physical damage) and all slim cases were in great shape translating into no throw aways. So, I am a happy camper with the product, the speedy arrival, the price, it fulfills my needs, and why I gave this product a five-star rating.
__label__2 Good deal: You can't find this stuff cheaper at retail stores. It does the job without scratching the screen. It will last you a long time too.
__label__1 Sad disappointment: What could be a fun game is so riddled with fatal bugs that I've deleted it after one day.The "solution" provided by 2K is to run a naked system; no firewall, no anti-spyware, no anti-virus, nothing. Come on people this is almost 2006, no one runs, or should run, a system without protection. I wonder what would happen if I actually wanted to go MP?The graphics are the best yet in the series, the interface is better but not great. But this is a complex game.I had installed the 1.09 patch so these comments are valid for the current version.Too bad I can't get my money back.
__label__2 Great toy, but what ...: This is a great toy, but what about that price? $160??? What parent in their right mind would pay $160 for a playdoh kit? Was that price typed in right? If so, you better re-evaluate.
__label__1 He who appears greedy will go broke: The emphasis on trying to make money to the exclusion of service will in the long run lead to failure to win or hold clients. Poor advice.
__label__2 Progaine for thinning hair: This is the best shampoo for thin hair. I have used this for over 10 years and have nothing but praise for it. I can only find it online now, so thank goodness for Amazon!
__label__1 Disappointing: Got this for my son this christmas. He likes it but finds it too bulky and no way near as easy to operate as his cousins iPod video. He's swithcing to the iPod as soon as he sells the Creative. I must say that the video on the creative is very good looking. Sharper than on Apples iPod. But keep in mind that the Zen is a portable videodevice and the iPod is a MP3 player with videocapabilities. It's NOT a Video iPod. Maybe something will incarnate at Macworld !
__label__2 It continued my journey: It continued my journey into learning about the Khazarian royalty that I could be descended from.
__label__2 Raffi Men"s Merino Wool Long Sleeve Mockneck Sweater: This is a well made sweater, and the price is great!It looks more expensive than price. Love the feel and softness,cannot say enough about this product. Fantastic buy!Purchase for a present,will purchase Raffi sweaters again.B.Mcmenemie
__label__2 Good: This works and I really just got it to get some information of my palm. It has kinda become obslete because I use my phone for everything that the palm can do and more.
__label__2 Great Little iPod Speaker Dock!: The sound quality from the Klipsch iGroove is fantastic! The system is easy to use, doesn't take up much space and is extremely portable. It even has a "handle" in the back to make it easy to move from place to place. The little remote that comes with the system is very convenient as well. I can change the volume or song playing on my iPod from across the room. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I've been enjoying the iGrove every day in every room in my house! I would highly recommend this product.
__label__1 It might just be me, but...: I can't think of anything positive. Case doesn't even approach looking like it would stay on. Hard to tell if the battery is of high quality because the case constantly falls off. I would suggest going with the standard sized replacement battery or another version with a different case.
__label__1 Agri Zap: "IT AIN'T NEVER CAUGHT A RAT (OR MOUSE) AND IT AIN'T NO FRIEND OF MINE.I WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT SUMMER TO REVIEW MY RATING.
__label__2 Installed and used it with no problems: I installed this unit in a win XP Home system. It was easily installed and worked on the first task. The software package is apparantly a nonSony package. The Instructions for loading and setup seemed to be good. However, what the software represents is another thing. I can't help wondering if it self destructs after a short time. I did not understand what the points of the two systems were, but I am sure if one buys a system, they should, unless clearly warned otherwise, get the tools that will make the unit functional. At this point I am not sure that Sony has provided me with durable software. The only note is "easy to use feature rich software". The MP3 feature is certainly only a trial. The remainder may have been lost in an asian electronic translator.
__label__1 This product is no good: I bought this product because I wanted to clean my silver necklace. The package says that it is supposed to remove all tarnish, however after soaking the necklace in the foam for literally an hour I managed to remove just a small portion of the tarnish. The necklace looks a little bit shiner but I would not say it's a noticeable difference. The foam is just a baking soda paste and I think there's no need to pay 6 dollars to get baking soda delivered to your door. Very disappointing.Clarification. After I got no results from vehemently rubbing and lathering the product on for about 15 minutes I decided I might as well dip the necklace inside the container and leave it there for a few hours. After more rubbing and lathering the results were minimal. It might be safe for gemstones but it doesn't really work for silver.
__label__2 I LOVE VAMPIRE DIARIES: I have seen the 2 seasons and now im watching the third one and i really love it. I just bought the Vampire Diaries book and I cant wait to read it.
__label__1 Worst Shave Possible: I do not like the double edge safety razor, even the cheap throw aways give you a bbs shave. Better to buy a different item.
__label__2 Great Idea!: I have been trying to conceive for several months and never thought about the lubrication causing a problem. I found out about Pre-Seed and ordered some. Great idea, great product. I highly recommend this to all my TTC friends!
__label__1 Useless: There are definitely better key rings out there if you just want to use it as a key ring. It is difficult to use this product as intended.. it being very small to handle. People with small hands might still find it handy but people with large or even medium hands would find it difficult to handle.The coating on top wears out after medium usage and the groves do not really fit in places it should actually do. Overall NOT a recommended buy.
__label__1 Terrible burns!: I tried this product and left it on for the recommended 2 minutes. It felt like it was burning, but I figured that was just because it was working. Well, I removed it, noticed some hair still there, so as the package said I could put it on those areas again for another 2 minutes. After that I was in so much pain. It removed the hair but gave me 2nd degree burns on my face! Very Very painful. My skin oozed for a coupole of days and then scabbed over. It looked horrible! Please give me my hair back. I'd prefer the blonde fuzzy hair to the burned painful, ugly skin I ended up with! Wish I could give it 0 stars!
__label__2 Kind of Hush by The Carpenters: Great CD. No one's voice compares to Karen Carpenter. I could listen to Carpenter CD's all day long and never tire of them.
__label__1 Basta Cosi: Never have I read such a mean spirited book about the most beautiful city in the world. Half way through, I had to put it aside because I couldn't stand reading about the author's demands of her landlady. I have rented apartments in Italy and never, once, have I encountered anyone less than charming and helpful. This is not to say that travel memoirs are supposed to be happy, and delightful but a little restraint would have helped the reading experience. I have the impression that she was mostly miserable while she was there and if she was enthralled, it didn't show on the page. A much better Venice book is "A Thousand Days In Venice" written with great enthusiasm and a true love of the place. If you're going to live in Italy, you are not entitled to complain!
__label__2 Ghosts of Old Louisville: Excellent. Kept your attention throughtout the whole book. I recommend this book especially for Louisville residents.
__label__2 Great for Inuyasha fans!: I have been waiting to give these Inuyasha's games another chance, Inuyasha fuedal fairy tale was good, and Inuyahsa the secret of the cursed mask was a complete joke! Anyway this game is very fun, it is like bodoukai three with Inuyasha characters. The only thing is it doesnt have many attacks as boudakai 3 or as many people. My favorite thing was the teams, all though my favorite characters are Sesshoumaru, Koga, and Inuyasha, they dont work good on a team... But that makes it more realistic, I mean it wouldnt be right if Koga and Inuyasha were working together! I think it is really cool that this game has Bankostu he is also very good, anyway I would wait till the price goes down to $19.99, by Christmas it should be down.
__label__1 Snoozer: I really enjoyed the first book written by this author but I found This book boring and couldn't even finish it. I would recommend skipping this one!
__label__1 Oops: My mistake, I accidentally ordered the wrong CD. But if this was the "Best of", I'm glad I never heard the regular Tyrone stuff. Anybody want a CD that has never even been played in its entirety?
__label__1 It would be smarter to give your money to the homeless: I bought this CD blind, after reading numerous reviews that hailed this group as everything from the reincarnation of Jimi to the heir apparent for Stevie Ray. Although I think the guitarist has decent chops, he doesn't live up to the hype that I expected. Maybe if there was less fuzz on this album, I'd appreciate him more.In addition, the sound quality of this album is bad enough to make someone dig out their old 8-tracks for another listening. It seems like a basement recording, with muffled everything.I honestly can't understand the buzz about Indiginous. Maybe a good regional band, but far from a national group. Frankly, In-A-Gotta-Di-Vida would rival this CD.
__label__2 Great quality for the price: There are only two issues I would point out with this microphone:1) The inline on/off switch with battery. It requires that you remember to turn on the microphone before use and turn off the microphone after use. You also need to keep a spare battery on hand.2) It is a mono plug. I use the microphone to record interviews where I'm plugging the mic directly into my camcorder. Since the camcorder can accept stereo sound, the microphone by itself only records onto the left channel. An inexpensive mono-to-stereo converter (about $2) found at any Radio Shack solves that problem.All-in-all this is a great little microphone. It is very inconspicuous on camera, picks up sound very well and the long cord is almost overkill for face to face interviews. If your subject needs to be mobile the cord would be a big drawback. However, if your subject is seated this is a perfect cost saving mic.
__label__2 Works great with a PROPER burner: I have a 16x NEC-3540a. Burns fine at 16x. They should be reliable also considering the 2 year old 4x Memorex DVDRs I have still work perfectly. Though those are 4x, but I'll see. For those with problems, upgrade... to a good burner (Plextor, NEC, etc.) Burners are too cheap now to own anything below a 16x.
__label__2 Interesting movie: A little strange, but still a very fun and adventurous story. I know some people find it a bit confusing, but it's highly enjoyable.
__label__1 Ratings down!: Starfleet is trying to get some information out of the Karemma, the same race that helped direct the Defiant to the Dominion communications relay in The Search (Part 1). The Jem'hadar get wind of this and are not impressed, attempting to destroy both the Karemma vessel and the Defiant. With the ship crippled, Sisko calls for them to head into the unstable atmosphere of a gas giant. Once in there they need to come up with a way to get home, all the while three meanacing Jem'hadar fighters are searching the gaseous atmosphere. The major characters get divided in the most hilarious circumstances that should've been serious but looked slapstick and totally scientifically inaccurate. Thinking that they're all going to die 'secrets' are revealed in the heat of the moment, nothing shocking, nothing exciting, add to that one of those "the Captain's going to die unless we get back in 40 minutes" stories and you have a melodramatic predictable episode.
__label__2 perfect: I buy this for personal use so that i don't have to go to gym for step aerobics class.It's unmovable when I exercise on it! perfect size and height!highly recommend for both personal and business use!
__label__2 Does a good job for the price: I have owned this griddle for 4 1/2 months and use it at least once or twice a week. I use it to cook pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage. It is great for all unless you are cooking a lot of bacon or sausage because the grease will leak underneath. When frying eggs make sure to pour the egg slowly onto the griddle or it will run down into the grease trap.The griddle folds in half--nice for those with limited storage space. Several reviewers noted that the removable plates are thin and this is true. They are very easy to remove and wash and they heat uniformly. I like the two temperature controls.
__label__1 Not so great: I too have a problem with the sling...actually, I have 2 problems. The sling won't stay in place....it snaps in before we start the bath but starts sliding around. My second problem is that the sling is slippery. My son just slides down. One time he slid so quickly that his back hit the grooves that the toddler ring snap into and it left a bruise on his back! I have to place a washcloth over the area to keep him from getting bruised again. I still use this tub because I refuse to spend any more money on an item that is only used for a few months but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.
__label__2 REAL Trance: Let me start off and say this album is fabolous,and by far Ferry's best album.The songs flow perfectly together,and provide so much uplifting,emotional energy...both melodic and epic trance that will make you melt.Any true appreciater of fine trance music will know right away that this is NOT amateur garbage(like some of the new trance)And to top that,it is live,who could ask for more?Way to go Ferry!I wish all of Ferry's albums could be as slammin'as this one.If your looking for a cd like this one,you wont find it on any of his cd's...this one is quite different from the rest.Any dance/trance music fan should go out and buy this album NOW!
__label__1 Gilgamesh for dummies: This is not a translation, as other reviewers have designated it. It is a "version", that is, a retelling based on the translations of others. It is overly sugary and cute. Passages from the original are reordered or omitted, while new passages are invented. This "version" doesn't hold a candle to Foster's genuine translation.
__label__1 Not as advertised: I received the holster, however it was not the paddle holster that was advertised. Instead I received a holster with belt loops. I would not order this its, or use the supplier again.
__label__2 Good: Poor special effects. Suspenseful but sometimes characters act unreal. Otherwise, a good show.And here are the other seven words.
__label__2 Still hooked: So we have reached the fifth book of the series. Like the first four series, Bloody Bones is packed with hard core fighting, bitching and all that macho stuff that Anita seems to handle quite well. I have enjoyed reading how Anita manages to maintain a balance in her life and how she handles every obstacle effortlessly.The book is good, but compared to the first four, this was quite a long read. I mean, I didn't quite enjoy this as much as the first four books. But it doesn't mean that it is not worth reading. I enjoy the love triangle but it becomes a drag throughout the story. Throughout the series, Anita is pictured to be a strong independent woman but sometimes she comes off bitchy. I don't know why. Still a good book, though not as good as the first 4.
__label__1 Tried it and think it is a waste of resources: The Topsy Turvy is not attractive. It is a green plastic bag. It was VERY difficult to load. I am very concerned about the success of this endeavor due to the weight of the full bag. Maybe it will produce a lot of tomatoes...I am hopeful. I am disappointed thus far as I was very excited about using the upside down concept. I could not recommend this to anyone at this point.Addendum Fall 2010This product is a waste of money. I threw it away after one season. Not only was it ugly, extremely difficult to load, very(especially after watering)heavy,and awkward to water... the plant grew poorly in full sun and produced very few tomatoes. I would advise that no one should purchase this product as I was very disappointed with it.
__label__1 not what i expected: i read midnight in the garden of good and evil, loved it, and was looking for something as good with savannah as the locale.after flipping through my copy of midnight in savannah, i ran to the post office and sent it right back to amazon. what a disappointment!
__label__1 Last good album: This one's got great groove,amazing production,beautiful vocals(of course),and for my money,was the last really strong effort from the Gibbs--the album punked out here in North America,but overseas it kicked ass.
__label__1 World War II in the Atlantic: The author titled his book wrong. He should have called it, "WWII in the Atlantic" or "U-Boat War". 2/3 of this book is spent in the atlantic theater. The author gives the pacific theater about as much attention as you would find in a high school history book. Disappointing how the author can spend chapters on u-boat attacks on convoys and only gives a few small pages to battles like coral, midway...etc. The biggest Naval battle to date, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, gets next to no attention in this book. Save your money, pass on this book.
__label__2 I Wonder Why The Dodo is Dead ...: While this is essentially a children's book it does provide some insight into the habits of animals and why they need us to help maintain their habitats.
__label__2 Great Guide: This a good coffe table book to own, the appearance of the book is fabulous and the information in it is even more interesting. The guide has not only a long list of some of the best drinks but also how to make them, what goes well with them, what kind of glasses to use and a little history on the alcohol itself.I've tried mixing several of the drinks and they came out fabulous.***This book appears at the Bargain section of Borders a lot. It's usually less than 5 bucks.
__label__1 Not for me: I bought this based on the great reviews, but I got to say it is quite disappointing. I bought this to unwind, but I find the voice-over narration really distracting. I can understand some coaching, but she never stops talking. She talks continuously, not quite sure why they even bothered with some music and the sounds from the ocean..you can't really relax and enjoy those sounds. Probably would have been an excellent DVD had the voice-over, loud, constant talking not completely ruined it for me. I also didn't like the way the sets are broken up into segments. Yoga should be flowing. Lastly, routines are repeated under different categories...there are enough yoga poses to have uniqueness within each category. Definitely not for me.
__label__2 The BEST cookbook I've seen for quick, easy veg. meals!: This is the BEST cookbook I've seen for quick and easy veg meals! I use this book constantly and every recipe has been delicious--no disappointments. What I really love about this book is that the ingredients are very accessible, usually items that I have in my house--nothing exotic or hard to find like in some other books. Also the ingredients lists are typically short--no long list of 20 ingredients for 1 recipe.The meals are pretty healthy and the book has many different types of items--everything from soups to stews to pastas etc...Good, solid, healthy veg. meals that are quick and easy to prepare. I couldn't ask for anything more...oh, except pictures maybe...
__label__2 i love it!: Becka Norwood had a perfect life till a girl named Honey Perkins jumps out of nowhere and starting to tell everyone in the high school that Honey is Becka's best friend. that's not it! because Becka doesn't even know Honey! from that on Honey starts to copy everything Becka has and does! That not enough, horrible "accidemts" starts to happen to Becka's real friends! so what does Honey want? just a best friend? or more? after you finished this book try the continuation of this book, The Best Friend 2.
__label__2 Wonderful Intro to basic problems in phonological theory: This text is a classic and should be required reading for any non-introductory student of phonology. Its strengths include its discussion of the basic issues of phonology and its lovely problem sets.Its greatest weakness is that many of the issues so clearly laid out in this book were of great concern to phonologists in 1977, but less so today.Still, while the model that phonologists use to represent, for example, "rule ordering" has changed, the discussion of "feeding," "counter feeding," "bleeding," and "counter bleeding" in this text, and certainly the language examples are relevant today.This book may not be ideal for a student who takes only one course in phonology since some of the discussion is outdated and a bit complicated. It is, however, a good place to start for any student who wishes to understand the issues of generative, linear phonology, even if only out of historical interest.
__label__2 Heres to small comforts..: I have 2 ferrets and they absolutely LOVE this bed. Its plush inside is a great bed for my little ones.
__label__1 A big yawn!: The bottom line: What's wrong with caring for all beings on this planet? Before you chow down on that drumstick, think good and hard about where it came from.Have some mercy people and for once, think beyond yourself!
__label__2 Excellent arrangement: Very good arrangement and more like SOS work of the 1980s. It still doesn't surpass Live at the Jazz Cafe (which I think is the best music CD I have ever heard, period).
__label__2 MOOVING: Wonderful story and pictures. An excellent opportunity for adults to explain to children animals other than human are neither good/bad or curious. That children are neither good nor bad. That children are naturally curious and often require guidance. The guidance has nothing related to good or evil. Strictly possible outcome. Is the parent, just observed, telling their child, if you go into the street you will be killed, or another recent observation,if you go out at night, the monsters will get you, in anyway being anything but being mentally lazy? Everything human is choice.
__label__2 Halfway to Forever: I have read In A Moment of Weakness, Waiting For Morning and then placed an order for Halfway to Forever before it was released. Karen Kingsbury saved the best of this series of books for last. She stated that we were saying goodbye to Tanner and Jade, Matt and Hannah in Halfway to Forever. I don't believe I have ever enjoyed a series of books any more than I did these. Superb in every way. Karen Kingsbury is one of the best writers of this time.
__label__2 New Show for Me!: The Steve Canyon show went off the air about the time I was born. I have just watched about a dozen episodes of the series and I am hooked but saddened that it only ran one season. Fun to see so many young actors getting going who we would later know from other shows. I don't know why the Steve Canyon show didn't catch on! I am biased because I like the older tv shows far better than I like the newer ones. The DVDs are well packaged and the behind-the-scenes material is priceless. The coolest features IMO are the vintage commercials and network promos included! I am old enough to remember cigarette ads on tv. Get Steve Canyon, pop the popcorn, invite a few friends over and enjoy!!!
__label__2 Catholic priest expose Churches greed and corruption!: To read first hand knowledge of the early beginnings of the Catholic churches entry into this country is facinating. To see a good priest stand up to his corrupt superiors is one to admire. The chapter dealing with Abraham Lincoln and who was behind his assination is something I never learned up until know. I highly recommend this book, it won't disappoint you!
__label__1 book is bunk: I first read this book in the '80's. This new book of lists is practically the same book. No new information, and much of it is just re-stated, if you have read the original Book of Lists, don't bother with this one.
__label__2 Worth it!(:: I love this product! If you are a vampire fan, than you will love this show. This is a perfect tie of drama, love, and supernaural. This is personal one of my favorite vampire tv shows-next to moonlight-and I recommend this to everyone who love supernatural shows.
__label__1 Beavis and Butthead: Let's be serious. Though funny at times, this must be the Beavis and Butthead guide to girls, dating, sex and relationships...
__label__2 Well-designed and foolproof: It's almost impossible to get less-than-excellent results with this waffle iron, short of wandering away and forgetting the waffles are baking. Easy to clean, easy to store, easy to handle (cool-touch exterior), and wonderful, airy, delicately crispy waffles.If you like waffles, just get it - you won't go wrong.
__label__2 Plant Heater: Bought two of these to use under my seed starting set up for the garden. Waterproof so it can handle the moisture, no shut off so it provides continuous heat and 1/4 the price of the systems sold at the nursery!used it for the 2011 growing season and got EVERYTHING going; Tomatoes germintaed in 72 hours. So did Cosmos, Zinnia, Brussel Sprouts and beets. Took another day or so for broccoli and eggplant but the pads performed beautifully on a timer, every day for 12 hours for 8 weeks.And the money I saved ($60 - $80) went for fertilizer, peat pots and other gardening gear!
__label__2 A NOTE FROM THE AUTHORS: When we were approached to put together the Glass Painter's Motif Library it gave us a great opportunity to answer one of our most asked questions - "What shall I paint?" Well you now need to look no further. This book really has something for everyone - something simple to something much harder. It really is very easy to find a design again too as the index to the book is very comprehensive and enables you to find a design quickly. This book is suitable for anyone that needs a design - whether it be a woodworker or a cross stitcher and of course a glass painter or two may also find it very useful - ENJOY. Barry Freestone and Alan Gear
__label__1 Paradoxical Player: The player's quality is good, the features excellent. Playing songs from the Compact flash card is easy and convenient.Here is the problem: How to get the songs on the card. RCA / Thomson Multimedia implemented a 'security' mechanism that allows you to transfer files (MP3/G2/WMA) only with the music management system delivered with the player. It takes - on my computers - 45 to 50 minutes to load one (1!) hour (64MB) onto the card. Since Compact Flash Cards cannot be considered as cheap removable media one has to 'reuse' the card. Given this fact 45 minutes to download music to the card is unacceptable.I am curious about the second generation of the iPod. Until then I will rarely listen to music with my Lyra2 since I don't have the time to download new titles to the card.
__label__1 Same problem as the PC version?: According to the reviews for the TurboTax 2002 PC version, the product can only be printed from one computer. If you change computer in the future, you won't be able to file an amended return. You won't be able to print your tax return if IRS audit you. Intuit also installs ... C-dilla on the PC. If the same [also] applies to the Mac version, I don't recommend using this product.
__label__2 Buffy The Vampire Slayer: This book is excellent if you love the show on the WB. She is the person we all would want to be. I love this book and would recommend this book to anyone, young or old. It's just a great book!
__label__2 Best Finger 11 CD EVER!!!: I got this CD of a friend a few years ago, and it sucked my right in...I Bought It and the Greyest of Blue Skies as well. If your into getting Finger 11 get this CD first, then greyest of blue skies.. and The self titled new one has 2 not so good singles I didn't even bother listening to it yet, why would I if I have tip ?
__label__1 Universal Learning Remote: Probably OK but would not fully learn the volume control function for an Olevia TV. Instructions lacking for use of the DVR controls.
__label__2 Great Movie: I have two children a 14 month year old and a 7 year old and they both think that this movie is great. My little one watches this during the morning, so I can shower and make breakfast. This movie has been fun for the children and a lifesaver for me.
__label__1 I've seen worse.: This will never win any awards, but I didn't hate it either. This may be interesting for those who want to see what happens when a man comes undone or reaches his snapping point. Many of the characters were one-dimensional and limited. There was no reason for the female lead to fall in love after seeing the main character in her strip club once. Even the kinky sex comes out of nowhere and is addressed in a shallow fashion. This is the type of movie I might have enjoyed as a teen before I had access to a certain type of movie, if you know what I mean. Luckily, there is some male nudity here amidst all the female toplessness. This film is really for viewers that have some time to kill.
__label__2 Excellent: My daughter loves this series then got me hooked, too. Shocking, Funny, Intriguing, and romantic. Great music, too, which is always a plus. If you like One Tree Hill, I think you'll like this, too.
__label__2 Maybe this will help...: A lot of people are writing about the size not being accurate -- the size of the 1-2s are the same as the 1s, but I noticed that the 1-2s have a blue liner. I am wondering if they're intended for babies who need the size of the 1s with the absorbancy of the 2s? Does anyone else know? Pampers doesn't have anything on their website...
__label__2 Fixed more than Our Table Issues (no doubt!): We brought this baby home, expecting the most. Boy, did we get it. It was one of those nights: Clarance and Arnold are "on their way", six others were expected. I had an amazing recipe from Marie Curie (Spanish salad!) and Ken had squeezed the juice clean from the cranberry. We threw the table together, and after some simple instructions (and not less than two stubbed thumbs) we were in "biz"! I would decide to tell anyone that this tool really has something for everyone. Pleased customer.
__label__1 A mistake: I accidently bought two copies of this DVD. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars had to be gaming the system.
__label__1 Beware of cost of updates - opnly one free update offered: I purhcased the nuvi 670 from Amazon several weeks ago and I was hapy with the unit until I checked to see if there were map updates avaialable from Garmin. Garmin's website stated that map updates were available for Europe and North America, but only one update was free. So I spent all this money on a International GPS unit only to end up with one map being out of date. When I received the unit it had a 2006 maps for Europe and 2008 maps fo North America. There were updated versions of both maps available, but I would have to pay for one of them - the cheap one costing close to $70USD. I contacted Garmin on several different occasions and they stood by their policy of only offering one free map update. What a disappointment with this supposively good company. You buy a GPS and it doesn't even come with the latest maps. I am very disappointed.Ron
__label__1 Bad.: Although I usually enjoy Ashanti's music, I'd have to say her single "Happy" holds a spot as one of her worst songs. It has a slow boring beat and airy, echoing vocals. It samples Gap Band's "Outstanding", but oh well, what do you expect? Also, this single also includes "Call", her album's WORST track. Please, for your own good, skip this.
__label__2 The Power in Metaphors: Estes has provided a great service to us all by preserving and interpreting these archetypal stories that pass on the wisdom of the generations that precede us with regard to living, loving, rites of passage, and dying. Second only to Joseph Campbell's work (The Power of Myth) in it's power to explain many of the facets of our lives. As equally valuable to men as to women.
__label__1 USB connection in tablet fails.: I bought this tablet and at first it worked fine. However after a couple of months it started failing. I would plug it in and nothing would happen - as if it's not connecting. Juggling the cord where it attached to the tablet would cause the light to flash on and off and if you held it 'just right' it would work... for a few minutes.Now it simply does not work at all.Other than that it worked fairly well when it worked. I did not like the included software - it was difficult to use and looked 'kludgy' to me.I suppose you get what you pay for...
__label__2 Can't be beat: I don't usually like these kinds of movies. I am more of a Disney fan, but for some reason this one really tripped my trigger. I love how it is relatively clean, and has a fun balance between action, adventure and silliness. I pull it out whenever I need a good laugh.
__label__2 Fine Trek: Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films, wisely returning the series to its serious roots. Kirk and crew are swept into a Cold War game of cat-and-mouse when the Klingon emissary they're assigned to protect is assassinated. Along the way, Kirk must confront his anti-Klingon racism, while Spock faces personal challenges of his own. Darker in tone (revealed particularly well through Cliff Eidelman's effective Batman-like score) and genuinely suspenseful, the film suffers only from a sense of failed grandeur--we keep expecting to see great battlefleets that never materialize. Director Meyer's characteristic anachronisms abound--the crew sleeping in WWII-style bunkbeds; an actual galley aboard ship--but he keeps the pace right, and sexy Cattrall and Iman are welcome additions. This is the last Trek featuring all of the original crew, delivered on a DVD that looks and sounds good.
__label__2 Classic movie!: Been looking for this movie on DVD for years. One of the all time classic comedies. Comedic timing perfect! Not your "action packed" comedy, but nonetheless a star-studded classic. Put on par with the original "Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."
__label__2 Wonderfully Fun!: I don't know who loves this disc more, me or my 3 year old! The Baby claps along too! Great songs that make you smile and tap your toes!
__label__1 Piece of Junk, Do Not Buy: I bought this adapter for international travel.It never worked.It arrived DOA, although I only found that out after it was too late.I was very lucky in my travels to be in places that had plugs that were US friendly and electronics with 110-240 transformers.Avoid, do not buy. You are better off with the Radio Shack plug adapters.Buyer Beware!
__label__1 Not worth your time or money: I kept reading hoping to find something of importance but zip. The weightloss solutions are to find a fad diet out there that you like. The exercises are nothing new. Save your money and go take a yoga class.
__label__2 humorous perspective on life and relationships: I only saw a portion of this movie toward the end of it and only "caught" a portion of the title, "Strangers" but was humorously entertained to watch the interaction of the humor among these ladies who are making the best of a bad situation and surviving. I think I watched this on "Sundance" TV channel, a great support for independent films, which I wish we had more of (I do not have a TV satellite dish, so I found this movie on a friend's TV). Great perspective on what life is about and what we are about when we have to be resourceful and compatible. If it were not for IMDB (International Movies Database), I probably would not have found this wonderful film. I will try to rent it soon at the video store and watch it completely. Yes, it may be considered more of a woman's movie, but I think a man could appreciate the humanistic aspect and the humor. I laughed as much with it as I do when I watch TV's and Red Foxx's "Sanford and Son."
__label__1 Perhaps a good bad movie!: "For the first time ever, the true adaptation of the classic novel..." says the back cover from the DVD.Yes, BUT:Unfortunately, the movie is BAD in every aspect of the word! Bad directing, bad acting, awful editing, an almost constant annoying synthethised music, half rendered (or unfinished?) special effects, etc, etc, etc...Fortunately, because it is so bad, it could become, with time perhaps, one of these cult movies such as Ed Wood's "Plan 9 From Outer Space", and which you could watch again with some B movies geeks just to have a good fun about it.
__label__1 waist of money: This was formatted in german and didn't say that anywhere. don't purchase movies from this person. Wish that i would have returned it.
__label__1 Abstract and bloody: The album can best be described as a disturbing abstract painting. It looks good in the museum, but you wouldn't want it hanging on your wall. I enjoyed listening to it once, and I got the art of it. It just doesn't leave me with a pleasant feeling, so I won't listen to it much more, if at all.
__label__1 What a waste of money: Purchased this for my apartment just to protect sliding door and front door. First of all the unit had to be within about 10 feet of the front door to pick up the sensor. Deciding to work with this was a mistake. Within a few weeks the unit would start beeping for no reason and the only way to stop it was to completely turn off the unit. I am one of those individuals who normally bo not buy junk and i have learned another lesson.
__label__1 Wrangler Jeans are impostors (mexico): I love Amazon.com, but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America. My husband says the cut is different and they don't fit him as well. We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now. I'm not sure if they're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back. Also, these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current (official) Wranglers don't have back pocket stitching anymore. My husband says, "no more internet jeans for him!" He wants to try on clothes in person.
__label__1 Save your money for something else: This book is one of the worst I have ever read. Although it seems well structured and covers many materials, the overall content just overwhelms the undergraduate student will many details and forces them to lose the whole point. The bottomline: buy it if you're a professor and knows the materials. But don't buy it if you ever want to learn vibrations extremely extremely well. I have to go search for another text to understand really what is going on. Better off without it....other than using it as a hw problem book.
__label__1 Review: I gave this book two stars because I am not big on reading books that include every detail of every second. I realie that when writing fiction books you must show a lot of detail to make the reader feel as though it is a real place or time but, when the main characters breakfast is describe to a "T", that is getting a little dicouraging. Ann Petry did write a good book, better than I could of wrote and I would recommend reading it to others but, I would never read it again. The ending left a little to be desired as well. When a book makes it hard for you to stay interested and then kind of leaves you hanging at the end it makes it hard to give it a good review.
__label__1 tired: This movie is everything I expected, a fine adaptation of a great comic, following the trend of X-men. But it is nothing more. If you want all of the excitement without the recycled hollywood superhero try reading the comic books. The only thing that might be worse is the new Ben AssFleck superhero movie.
__label__1 Wack: Lil Kim is [bad.] She cant rap, and shes just selling her image. I listened to this CD yesterday, the beats are pretty good, but if you want lyrics pick up 50 cent, freeway or fabolous, not this... Also, in terms of female rappers Trina and Foxy Brown are better.bottom line: dont waste the money!
__label__1 Gossip of the Worst Kind: The writer says at the beginning that Bob refused to talk to him for this book so instead he seeks out ex-girlfriends, fired band members, relatives of those Bob supposedly done wrong (e.g. Phil Ochs) and records their mostly negative observations about Bob. If you want to read a lot of rumors and Bob bashing along with a rehash of what has been printed in other biographies.....this Bob's for you!
__label__2 remember when blink was punk?: if you've forgotten that blink-182 used to be a punk band, this cd will remind you in a hurry. from the opening glory of "carousel" and "m&ms" to the three "joke" tracks at the end, it embodies the pure spirit and irreverence that those poor sell-outs have forgotten. if you only know the blink of "enema of the state," odds are you'll like it anyway, but there's a whole world of beautiful punk music which intentionally shuns airplay that you'll never know. pity. if only no one discovered blink, maybe they'd still be making good music. cheshire cat is a classic album by a band which no longer exists.

__label__2 good straightener for the price: I bought this for my daughter and she is very happy with it. She wanted the Chi brand but I wasn't willing to pay that much money for a straightener. This product heats up quickly and works very well.
__label__2 Fact or fiction?: Powerful, well researched and written book. The story grabbed me from the beginning and I followed the main character's life religiously. I was very disappointed to find out at the end it was fiction. Did anyone else think they were reading a true story? I have recommended this book to many of my friends who have also been enthralled. Buy this book! (by Brenda)
__label__1 Absolutely awful! Learn your way right out of a job.: I have seen more than a hundred books on Java. The only Java book worse than volume 1 of this series is volume 2. The author demonstrates only a superficial understanding of his subject matter. Countless errors range from code bugs to thorough misunderstanding of the issues associated with the patterns he presents. Readers of this volume will be guided into inferior designs with greater likelihood of rework.Some companies are now starting to use this material to judge applicants. Applicants who quote this material or show similar levels of misguidance are being turned away, judged not fit to hold positions as experienced software developers.Readers wishing to learn design patterns should start with the GoF book (Design Patterns by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides). A thorough understanding of that book's material will greatly benefit the reader. Patterns in Java will serve only to midguide, misinform, and confuse.
__label__2 Warms wax: It warms the wax that rips out my hairs. This is painful. Occasionally there is blood but at least no more hair. The bad stuff is not the product's fault. It does what it's supposed to do and does it well.
__label__1 Pretty bad and shallow: I can't see any real reason to read this book, nothing was explored very deeply, characters, situations, ethics. The whole message seemed to be, "Sit back, watch, and live with everything."
__label__2 Wonderful book: I read this book many years ago, and make a point of reading it again at least once a year. Long before tattoos were acceptable for women, I got a crying heart tattoo because of how this book touched my heart.
__label__1 Doesn't work; poor customer service.: I started having problems with Screen display from the start. It flickers and then goes gray. My first email to the company for assitance was ignored. The second email was replied to and made no sense. A phone call placed earlier today to customer service has yielded no response. I've been able to watch two movies in two months.
__label__1 Burt Reynolds ruined this book for me: I have listened to the Spenser CDs with Joe Montegna and couldn't get past listening to chapter 4 with Burt Reynolds. His monotonous voice made much of the text incomprehendible. Read the book and skip the audio book for this one.
__label__1 The ProBlend has a mind of it's own: I bought one of the B&D BL600 ProBlender approximately 2 months ago. It works pretty good for blending but mine will not turn off soemtimes when you push the off button. The blender turns on when you're not even in the same room with it. The plastic around the blade is melted away some, I'm not for sure why. I do not leave it plugged in when I am not using it. I would like to get another one but I am afraid that I will have the same problems.
__label__1 Black to White Toast: While the frozen feature is nice, I think I could have gotten VERY unevenly toasted toast from a much less expensive unit. It has made me rethink acquiring more products from this company for my kitchen.
__label__2 Closet Organizer: After searching high and low in the stores I finally found the pink closet organizer with the help of Amazon.com. The product is exactly what I expected it to be and the process was so easy! Thanks Amazon for all your help in getting ready for this baby!
__label__2 Singer Songwriter who is an original: If you like originality and poetry in music I would suggest this CD for your collection. "The Dutchman" to me is one of the best songs around. I loved Cashman and West's version; but to hear it delivered by the man who wrote it is a special treat. If you enjoy originality and poetry I would recommend this CD!
__label__2 Pretty good device: I bought this recently when cat sitting to keep them fed overnight and in the morning. At first, the 2 adult cats were a bit hesitant to eat from it but shortly after, I could tell they were not starving. The timer makes it turn at the indicated intervals and is very simple to use. The only problem is that the clear plastic cover was cracked when I got it, but it still works just fine.
__label__2 Wonderful music by a superb guitarist: This is a must have if you're into fingerstyle guitar. Pleasant, but not boring or avant-garde compositions make for a good listen. Price, quality and delivery time were very good.
__label__2 I would just order everything by TBS now - why wait?: 'Snow Showers' has to be one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. 'Ripples' has a great, explosive chorus(explosive by TBS standards) and 'To Leave It Now' is instantly pleasing and I LIKE the French speak in the background. 'Sometimes I Still Feel The Bruise' is just terrific songwriting. I have one other TBS album but this is my fav! Their sound seems to be evolving, becoming more lush and polished. Anyone agree?
__label__1 Royally hard to play, install and watch: The graphics are okay, but the controls are very difficult making the game impossible to play. i reccomend not using Windows XP to play it, even though Xp is what i have, it is a Very good Program windows XP is, and it will play anything. well, it didnt play Coffin rock, would not install it, couldnt Patch it. Rustin parr and Elly kedward played and installed just fine. the point being i payed for 3 games to play Not 2. the controls and Glitches make you think your Pc is Fixing to Crash, the game freezes up, Refuses to cooperate, anD Closes. The problem is that It uses Nocturne as its engine, Nocturne uses up alot of Hard drive space and Will slow even the most Newwest and defragmented of Pcs. just dont buy this game, its a waste of money.
__label__2 Anything About Tesla Would be Astounding, But This Bio Could Have Been a Bit More Inspired and Factual: The author is a good writer who has chosen a towering, almost out of reach, subject. My only quibble is a bit of meandering in the structure of the book, a faint tone of confusion (perhaps due to the enormity of the "genius") and a slightly too bedazzled attitude on the part of the biographer. Good job, but one day Tesla will get a really talented, penetrating biographer and the resulting book will blow the tops of people's heads off. What he did, fooled around with, patented, and so on was entirely incomrephensible to most during his lifetime and still remains spooky to most people today.
__label__2 The Used gets better and better with each cd they put out: Very rarely do I find an album I instantly love after one listen. This was one of them.I bought Lies for the Liars, expecting a cross between their last two albums. What I got was something very different. Yes, they sound different, but it's in a very good way. After all, who wants to hear the same songs, just with different words? It's very diverse and addicting. I've listened to it at least 30 times since it came out. I believe everybody could listen to this album and find at least one song they like.Buy the album! It has an incredible design on the album booklet, and some of the album versions have bonus tracks. It's definitely worth the buy.
__label__2 things my mother never told me: this book is a gold mine of information about verbal abuse and domestic violence relationships...how to tell if you are in one...types of verbal abuse...how to respond and protect yourself...and how to get out of the relationship
__label__1 A big build up to an anti-climatic ending: Still having the ending fresh in my mind, I must say that it would be hard to write a more disappointing ending except by just failing to write one altogether. The story was all building up to one epic ending, and instead of a satisfactory delivery it feels like a fizzling white-wash that leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and a desire to smack the author.Get anything else by Lovecraft. This isn't entirely written by him, but also August Derleth who must have concocted that awful ending.
__label__2 Any poet to translate this book from Spanish into English?: This is an intense, powerful, beautiful novel, full of pain and hope. Ms Gonzalez-Monserrat uses a poetic prose to describe an encounter between two Cubans, one living in Miami and one living in Havana, both victims of opposing ideologies that sent them to faraway wars: Vietnam and Angola. One will never know if the events were real, imagined or dreamt about. The thoughts and feelings expressed by the author may also apply to other exiles from other parts of the world who had (and have) to leave their countries because of political, religious or cultural oppression. I cried a lot while reading this book. Perhaps it was a catharsis for the author. It can be one for the reader as well.
__label__2 Three DVD set available on Hallmark for $29.95: The three DVD collection is still available at the source for $29.95. No need to pay $75 for a used one. Search Hallmark for "Sarah Plain and Tall" or use this link:http://makeashorterlink.com/?R2681265A
__label__1 Finding Their Way: Up shows R.E.M. trying to find their identity after the unexpected retirement of Bill Berry. For the most part, they are unsuccessful. There are flashes of what you'll later hear in the far superior Reveal, but just not enough to make it worth recommending. "Day Sleeper" and "At My Most Beautiful" almost save the day, but not quite.
__label__2 Proof for all Non-Believers....Faeries are real....: This is one of the most influental books I have read. Even as a small child, I would talk to the trees and flowers in hope that I would get an answer from the Faerie folk. The illustrations are magnificent and the text is wonderfully written. I would suggest this book to anyone who is truly an innocent eyed child at heart.
__label__1 The best thing I can say about this ...: The best thing I can say about this product is that it didn't have that awful medicinal smell like most products containing tea tree oil. The package claimed to make hair shinier and healthier but after using it my hair looked dry and frizzy. In addition, my hair got tangled much quicker than normal. Perhaps if I used more it would have worked better, but the package didn't indicate how much to use and I thought I used quite a bit.
__label__1 Piece of junk: I installed this piece of crap on my HP machine. After installing when the kids try to run this from their non admin account this won't even start. Errors out with 'Error setting up channels'. So this crap requie admin privliege to pry on your accounts!?! And the contact # published on the inset paper was disconnected and the number on their website goes to a dead end voicemail. No replies for my emails even after 48 hours. I also would strongly agree with other people's comment about the online (not just online but a broadband online) scam! Never buy this product and I would even say never buy anyother product from such a seller even if that product is really good!
__label__2 Fabulous snack!: These nong shim sweet potato snacks hit the spot. I loved the crunch and they weren't overly sweet or overly spicy- just the perfect mix!
__label__1 Too "flexible" to hold a Nikon D5100: The main downfall about this flexible tripod is that you can not adjust how tight you want the legs or head to be to prevent movement. Could not hold my D5100 to save its life. Stick to this for pocket cameras.
__label__2 Auto/biography fact or fantasy?: Maya Angelou's 'Caged Bird' is an autobiography in spite of the fantasies within it. There are moments when the reader is asked to become more objective than Maya herself is, as she accepts that her brother Baily made ice-cream out of snow which is not possible. Autobiography is a problematic form of literature as it is hard for an author to remember, distance and understand events in their lives which shaped them. You must read it for youself to understand. It is a cracking fictionalised version of Maya's life!!!
__label__2 splash review: The video was here on time and was in excellent shape and a lot more entertaining than we remembered 20 years ago!!
__label__2 I really liked this movie: If you enjoy film then you will truly enjoy this one: a very witty comedy in the vein of "Swingers" meets "Diner" meets "My favorite Year". Shatner is absolutely hilarious!(and I hated Star Trek) and Weigel and MacCormack have chemistry much like Favreau and Vaugn in "Swingers". Independent all the way but with commercial appeal.
__label__2 A Must Buy!: The story lines were incredible and it's a movie that gives hope. The cast line-up was also great! Definitely something to watch over and over again.
__label__2 Essential book for animation art fans....: This attractive tome is a great value (highest quality binding, printing, graphics reproduction, etc) and showcases what looks like another Disney/Pixar masterpiece. I have not seen the film itself (..since it has not yet been released at this time of my review), but I thoroughly enjoyed following the book's presentation of the work, from plot conception to final rendering. The raw animation art and the stills from the film are outstanding, and allow one to get the "feel" of what the story is about.In my opinion, Pixar has already captured the true Disney spirit and quality (i.e., what Walt himself demanded in his products) in the films that it has produced jointly with The Disney Company. It certainly appears, from this fine book and other sources, that "Finding Nemo" will be no exception.You can purchase this book now and enjoy it, or you can wait for its upcoming Summer, 2003 release. Either way, you won't go wrong!
__label__1 Used to like Satch, hearing this cd, just another guitar wanker: I actually used to like Satriani and the Surfing with the Alien album alot. Listening thru this compilation though, i realize, that he puts in a good riff into each song, and a good melody line, but then it's just repeated as infinitum, i'm not getting anything from these songs except tone / atmosphere, there is no story being told like you'd hear with a Schenker (or even a Malmsteen). That's not to say i don't like instrumental albums, i do, and some fave guitarists are: Michael Schenker (acoustic and electric), Link Wray, Leo Kottke, Ynwie Malmsteen, Birelli Lagrene, Albert Lee, and Jeff Beck (during his You Had It Coming / Jeff cds period), but in reality Satriani now comes off as just another 80's guitar wanker who sounds like he's playing in his house somewhere in time to a drum machine
__label__2 Cd Player Review: The cd player works well, just wish the random play would work for all of the cd's instead of only one.
__label__1 Esther's Gift: A Mitford Christmas Story: What a disappointment!! I have read everything Karon has written and this was nothing more than a cake recipe. Don't sell your readers short. Wait and write a story when you have something to say.
__label__2 Healthy snack: These are a good, healthy snack. They're not too salty and come in a good portion size. They have a good freshness seal but are easy to open. If you like peanuts, you cant really go wrong with these.
__label__2 Good resource: Very good resource book for any student who is working on their dissertation or thesis now or in the future.
__label__1 The best is yet to come.: The GoodThe grit of the setting and GRRMs writing style is entertainingThe BadThe series itself is on a rollercoaster Book 1 simply superb, book 2 slow a little boring but setting things up, book 3 one of the best books ever once things where set in motion they just wouldn't stop. Book 4 disappointing, bad way to split it and slow which will likely set up book 5 to be good. So he can end the series with a bang I hope the series goes to eight books.The UglyThe Cover, how did this go so wrong. Don't Judge a book by its cover...worst cover...worst book ...hmmm.Splitting the book, ok he gambled and IMO it failed hard core, he would have been way better off to release a 2500 page monster (and charge much more or release two books Feast I and Feast II simultaneously).The audio tapes, why did they get another reader?
__label__2 Great Movie but.....: This is a really fantastic movie but it has been ruined for me on the DVD release. Everything is so PINK!! The colour transfer is terrible. For good picture quality, keep your Laser Disk version. Otherwise the package was very good - especially the song videos.
__label__1 Boring and excessively wordy: I had to read this for a class (that was out of my major). So I guess I'm not really in the target audience. If you like reading sentences like:"In this reverberation, the poetic image will have a sonority of being."Then you'll probably like this book. By the way, this is from the second page of the book, so the author hasn't really defined what he means by "reverberation" and "sonority of being" yet. As far as I can tell, he never really defined any of these terms (other than in some mushy mashy way invoking a bunch of other weird terms that I didn't understand).I dunno, maybe I'm too simple a man to enjoy this stuff. I guess if you are considering buying it, you should go read the book preview. The entire book sounds exactly like so if you can stand that style, then I guess there are some insights to be had in there. But to me it all just came off as academic sophistry.
__label__1 A letdown, not like the first: After Children of the Ice, I hoped this would become a moving series of books on pre-historic America. It wasen't to be. Native American lesbians!!?? Sexual torture, wife-beating? Ms.Prentiss went from a very good story of Historical Fiction to some strange ideas about Native American life. A big letdown, none of the rest of her books are worth reading, they are all in the same vein as this one.
__label__2 THIS ALBUM IS TOTALLY WORTH IT: I was delighted to see that L. Cohen had a new album out. People that dont like this album either don't like Leonard Cohen because they don't get it, or are very boring people who can only enjoy granola music of the slower tempo Dead Can Dance variety. Go No More A Roving, Because of, and Undertow are extremely fine songs that make this album a must. I don't see how anyone with a heart can not fully appreciate Undertow for the beauty that it is. Because of is also a very sexy song. The other songs are quite good as well.I would also definately recommend TEN NEW SONGS, for those of you who quit buying his albums after the FUTURE. It is every bit as important and sexy as the Future and Im Your Man. This guy knows how to pick his back up singers.
__label__2 Not really Amorphis' style, but good anyway!: This EP doesn't really represent Amorphis' style of music, but they showed that they can play other kinds of music as well. Great songs, very melodic, but NOT HEAVY METAL. If you heard one of Amorphis' earlier records (The Karelian Isthmus, Tales from the Thousand Lakes - awesome CDs) chances are you will like this, too, although the music is a very different style. Take a peek with RealAudio!
__label__2 Much better than anything else I've tried: Great product! Of course very painful at first but eventually it hurts less. The only complaint I have is itchy legs! Then again I used to have itchy legs before when I shaved too. I had very thick regrowth while shaving now they are growing thin. It's a great alternative if you can't afford laser removal. I recommend it.
__label__1 Voice Changer? No.: Length:: 2:43 MinsThis is not a voice changer, this is something that kind of adds on to your voice, droning in the background.I put it on, and of course, like all the "1"s said, the head peace busted right off (that's what I get for being born with a big head) --- but it's not as bad as they say, you can put it back on if you know how to work it right...But lets get real, this thing does not make you sound like Darth unless you have your ear right up to the little speaker that will sit on your chest.It's really kind of weird that they put the speaker at the base of the control panel... if you were really short, and the person wearing it were really tall, maybe then it would make sense...Anyway, long story short, but the TRANSFORMERS voice changing helmet... the Darth Vader one is kind of lame.
__label__2 The record set straight: A great read. An insightful, honest, and funny book about one of our greatest presidents. A must!
__label__1 Broken in less than 2 months: We purchased this coffeemaker in February and April 1 it broke. I have written Mr. Coffee to find out how to get a replacement part. It's a small but essential component that shuts off the flow of water when the carafe is moved from the warming plate and reopens the flow when it is replaced. In addition the warmer stays on for a mere 60 minutes with no adjustment as to how long it should stay on. I suggest you avoid this product.
__label__1 Change your thoughts, change your destiny: It has a powerful message about how to change ones thoughts, however I don't really think the concept is anything new. Its very positive, but felt that it was a little supferficial and it's over priced.I would recommend watching it, but not worth buying.
__label__2 Campy: I remember watching this movie when I was about 8 years old, thinking it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen. Aside from Flight of the Navigator, of course. I probably watched it a million times. Now, my 9 year old daughter is heading to space camp in a few months. I all of a sudden remembered this movie and instantly had a strong desire to watch it again, with my daughter.Yes, the plot is unbelievable, corny, campy, whatever. But it is a fun movie that your kids (10 and under) will love. It's one of those movies that's great to fall asleep to on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
__label__1 No Coperation- defective merchandise: I bought this & the adapter part did not work- I used the small card in my son's adapter & it worked- I emailed & asked for a new adapter- NO NEW ADAPTER!! I was very disappointed. I did not want to return the entire item because only the adapter did not work-
__label__1 Financial Freedom Through Self-Indulgent Authorship: It's hard to believe that this was published in December, 2000. The author describes NYSE scalping without decimalization and Chapter 1 describes a trade in INTC at 137.Overall, this "how-to" was far too esoteric and short on strategy. The author is a psychologist which is all one needs to know.There are much better resources available inlcuding Nassar's book and the Underground.com Guide.
__label__1 Sucks: I thought both ledges came in a package. It's not as wide as I thought it would be. I just think I should have built one myself rather than spend the money to buy this. Way overpriced.
__label__2 Be careful opening: The third time I took the top off the spray bottle, it literally came off with the stem and glass attached to it. I was able to pour the perfume into an atomizer and not lose the entire contents of the bottle as a result, but what a disappointment.
__label__1 Definitely has taste: I recently had weight loss surgery and couldn't stand the ready-to-drink protein shakes they wanted me to have, so I asked about protein powder to make my own drinks and they recommened whey protein. I bought Any Whey's "virtually tasteless" powder and much to my disappointment found it does in fact have a strong aroma and taste. The first time I tried it I added it to juice and couldn't stomach the stuff. I then tried milk, soup, yogurt and many others, but it always added a taste. When added to just water, I was able to pinpoint the flavor. It tastes like liquid graham crackers. I normally love graham crackers, but I don't want everything I drink to be tainted the sweet taste. I'm on to try the next "tasteless" powder to see if it is any better. Overall not worth the cost. If possible, order a small size to be sure you like the powder before buying a whole 2.7 pounds. My mistake!
__label__2 Workhorse - Still going strong after 17 years!: Just thought I'd let prospective buyers know that this machine really is a reliable workhorse. I'm frequently amazed by how poorly so many new appliances are constructed. My 20+ year old KitchenAid mixer, my ancient Cuisinart food processor and this bread machine have all been excellent investments.I primarily use the bread machine as a dough maker and sourdough/poolish starter. If I do make bread in the machine it's to take advantage of the timed start feature so that we can wake up to hot cinnamon craisin bread on cold mornings.UPDATE: I gave this breadmaker to a friend who needed it to actually make the bread from start to finish. She uses it weekly. That means this breadmaker has been going strong for 17 years. If ONLY manufacturers would return to making quality products.
__label__2 Best Holiday book there is.: First of all, I remember this story from when I was a girl and when I saw the movie and books come out again I remembered what a magical story it was and how all I wanted was to ride the Polar Express and get one of Santa's sleigh bells. Now, I got this book for my son who loves Christmas and trains. I am saving it for Christmas, but I am not worried. I KNOW he will love this book. This is a definate keeper forever. I got the hardcover. Personally I want this book to last untill I am so old I cant read anymore. This is one of the best childrens books there is out there. Not just for Christmas, but for all time. After I got the book, I sat down and took the journey again by myself. You are never too old to feel the magic.
__label__1 A Gradually Disappointing Series: After watching Season 1 & 2 and possibly Season 3, I thought this show offered a undemanding but well-written comedy with just the right touches of humanity. It actually bothered me that its simplicity kept me wanting more. But half way through Season 3, I realized this series was spiraling into just another hypnotic search for humor and the show really needed to end. Weeds, perferably would have ended on a good accord and not accede into a slow death. Season 5 is that slow death. As long as viewers habitually watch, whether good or bad, writers will dig for material, sadly it's not the characters but the script that's terminal. This series is far removed from it's original content. Lay this down in the graveyard of over-run shows starting with Season 4 and death with 5. Don't expect resurrection on 6. Mary-Louise Parker is still awesomely adorable!
__label__1 Advertise what you sell.: I received this book promptly in the mail. When I opened it up, the back part was separated from the rest of the book and the cover was barely on. I was told that the book was new, but it should have been sold as acceptable. It would have cost more to send it back and get a new copy than to just deal with it.
__label__1 "Falling Asleep": I was very disappointed in this novel. I'm a longtime Krentz fan, in all her guises, and found this so boring I didn't finish it. If she's going to segue into more of a mystery venue then I wish she'd just do it and drop the cutsey stuff. She certainly has the talent and experience to do so. This just put me to sleep.
__label__2 Island of the Blue Dolphins: I thought this book was a great book because it was suspensful at some parts and was very interesting. The part I liked the most was when Karana found the leader with the arrow in him and she healed him and keeped him as a pet and he always barked at the gulls and laid in the sand and sleeped....
__label__1 Ezzo impersonating God: Ezzo appears to have climbed into the mind of God, and now pretends to speak for him. "...God's divine intention for parents to use physical pain to correct a child's rebellious activities." God's son would be the first to object, as even a cursory reading of the New Testament would tell us. Ezzo tells us to hit the child "to free him of his guilt of sin". Those who completed Psych 101 recognize this as projection. Ezzo is a man in deep psychiatric trouble, and before he does more harm to children ought to be taken into custody for psychiatric counseling.- Norm Lee, author of Parenting Without Punishing
__label__1 Poor quality instructions: I am so disappointed of this video. Where do I begin? The pacing is mediocre and not planned. Poor instructions and he looks like he makes it up as it goes....don't waste your money!!!!!
__label__2 A delightful account of the Reagan era: Peggy Noonan's autobiography of her years in the Reagan White House is simply a wonderful book. She has an engaging style, penetrating insight, and charming humor. Admittedly conservative, she defends her point-of-view with eloquence and logic. But this must be expected. She was a gifted speech writer. Reagan and Bush senior were fortunate to have the use of her talents. And now we have her account as a valuable historical record. Read it! You will enjoy this book. Highly recommended.
__label__1 Rapturous Book - not!: Oh dear, what a mistake I made in thinking this sounded like a good thriller in the making. What it is in reality is religious propaganda - can't believe I was sucked in. Didn't bother past the "revelation" of the RAPTURE. Beware of the freebies!
__label__1 Where's the Beef?: I am always up for a "movie challenge" but this film had me in stitches. Johnny Depp and the mystery woman ride away on their bike..hair not moving...background that's obviously fake...Was this made in the 70's? Also, the sex scene at the end with the mystery woman...the wild face...the terribly fake and overdone background coupled with even more hilarious music...I just could not get past the cheesy effects without howling with laughter...even the scene showing the dead Baroness in the wheelchair...more humor than fright. Sorry, I wasn't impressed, but if you like campy...it's great!!!
__label__2 Not essential, but interesting: I like this book for the inspiration it offers and the interesting historical information. This would definitely not be a beginner book--you would want to understand sock knitting and have made a pair first.I will probably knit a few of the patterns and use the rest as inspiration. I'm glad that I added it to my collection, but it is not essential. Also, if you are looking for a learn to knit book try Antje Gillingham's Knitting Circles Around Socks. She uses the 2 circ. method, and it is very easy to understand.Overall, a nice book, but not essential.
__label__1 Truely boring, not a real western!!!: I love western movies, but this truly had to be the most cheezy, boring,and dull remake of a classic I've ever seen. Here are many more problems with this movie below:1. The little girl is way too anoying that throughout the first 10 minutes you wished she would leave the screen. Instead she's the main character, so your stuck with a whinning little brat the whole wasted time watching.2. Hardly any gunfights and the small few are poorly played out as if your watching Little House On The Prairy.3. Extremely boring, with no suspence,the main bad guy seems to be too nice and fake, real crappy acting.4. This movie should've been rated G and can easily be understood by 3 year olds.
__label__2 Not given enough credit: This C.D. is good. It may be different from their other 3 C.D.'s. (yes three), but I respect their change. I don't think anyone is giving them enough credit. I hope this C.D. will grow on people as it has on me.
__label__1 should be much better: The overall idea of the game is good. But Very poor interaction with the wii fit board and controller. Contacted their tech support. They have to be one of the worst out there. The directed me to read three different forums, one being their own, none had any titles for the product!It alternates between your two goals you pick. The general progression is good it will back off when you flatten out and then step it up again when you progress. Also, it does have some good ideas for meals.
__label__1 beware - works on smooth surfaces only: We have had the same experience as another reviewer - not enough large very smooth (think smooth gym floor, not ashphalt or sidewalk) surfaces. We have hardwoods but have rugs/seagrass over the larger portions of floor. We took the cars to an outdoor tennis court hoping to fare better but could not build up speed. Wish we knew the trick to make them work on semi-rough surfaces or had known that they didn't work unless there was a large smooth surface before buying.
__label__2 100 girls: This unknown movie is a, "gem." It has a lot of truths between how each gender perceives the other. It may not have played out in your local theater, but it is worth watching when bored. Similar movies within its class would be a, "boy girl thing" and, "the cutting edge." Truly a fun movie to see with your better (or worse) half.
__label__1 Protection plan not honored: I've had an iPad2 for about a year now. I sent the iPad2 back to apple because it was not charging. Apple is claiming oxidation in the connector is the cause and this was not covered by their warranty. It seems they have better lawyers than repair technicians. If there was a department of consumer affairs, I would file a complaint. My apple protection plan was clearly a waste of money. Apple offered to repair the iPad for $250. I think I'll stick it on a shelf as a reminder of Apple's customer commitment.
__label__1 Worst Star Wars novel EVER!: Out of the more than 40 published Star Wars novels, this is by far the worst.It is more or less suited for kids, and not for adults with a keen interest for the Star Wars galaxy.I pride my self with having read every Star Wars novel that has been published so far, but many times I was tempted to put this one down and ban it from my Star Wars novel collection.
__label__2 Before the storm: The prose is quick and lively, entertaining but chilling. The sense of foreboding never eases. His class of society is broader than Berlin Alexanderplatz, but there is the same grittiness.On the other hand, the description and picture of the all night baths showed a refinement that we could emulate. It was a happy marriage of a Russian sauna and a upscale YMCA.The photos are excellent, and add to the sense of the GegangendeZeit.
__label__2 Great customer service!: We had a little snafu and these guys fixed it right away.Thank you. Nice to do business with you.
__label__2 Mug: I am SOOOOOO happy that i bought this tea mug! It's got such a different, yet very comfortable shape. I love drinking from it and it has quickly become my favorite cup. I'd recommend anyone to buy one!
__label__1 too slow: Good luck staying awake through this one, and if you do manage to see any action in this, it is very generic, as well as the acting. Bring a pillow Zzzzzz. picture quality and sound are good, gave it an extra star for that
__label__2 The Best Book Ever Written: Although all the books written by Dr. Dyer are extremely helpful, this one really makes you a better person. This book enables one to become at peace with oneself & others. Should be made 'compulsory reading' in colleges.
__label__1 Nursing Students Beware!: Bought this for my wife who is a 1st year nursing student.PROS: It's a wonderful LOOKING Pack.CONS: It's cheaply made and the handle is extremely weak. After just 3 days of use, the handle broke and I had to repair it myself. Then the zipper stopped zipping. There's not enough room in this thing for all of those nursing books.
__label__2 No fools here!: Kate Martinelli continues to enrich my world. Erasmus lives in my neighborhood. The subject matter, a cultish offshoot of christianity, was absolutely facinating to me. To learn more a bout a character I like and a brand new subject, what a delight. Kate and her lover continue to be richer characters with each novel.
__label__1 Worked fine until...: Was quite happy with this modem for the first 15 months I had it - easy to set up, no problems. Until it died at a most inconvenient time. Wouldn't recommend!
__label__2 Sheryl love's to cook (Fairbanks): Christmas is my favorite time of the year and I am always trying to find meals that are healthy and quick to prepare because Christmas is such a busy time of the year for everyone.
__label__1 I give up...: My F11 starting failing after a couple of years. It would run up to 220 BPM even though no was else was in sight. Or it would just shut down altogether and then start back up. And even if it hadn't failed, it was not very intuitive at all. Terrible menu system. Hello Garmin Forerunner 305 - perfect.
__label__1 DRM Kills This Game: DRM makes this game unplayable. DO NOT BUY unless you are willing to spend a lot of time just trying to install the game and getting through all of their rights management crap.AGAIN DO NOT BUY!
__label__2 Another look from the top of command:: Insight is key to this book written by Grant from basically his death bed. What we learn from Grant in this book gives us an opportunity to understand his intentions, strategies and how he worked with people. Grant tries to be very fair in his writing that covers his early days as a colonel to full-fledged commander of the US Army. His style is basic and easy to understand. At times the book feels like he is giving a history lesson about the war and sometimes is vague about triumphs or failures. I was looking forward to reading about Grant's work with the battle of Cold Harbor and he was completely brief in this book considering it was a major conflict. But, this was Grant's choice to write and memoir depth is subject to author decision. Grant does pack a lot of information in and also has interesting coverage in regards to Lee's surrender. Anyone studying Grant or looking for further insight owes it to themselves to consider reading this book.
__label__1 Hideous: I don't know where that other guy on here was coming from, saying that this is an action movie that keeps you at the edge of your seats (Disney can't make action, the little kids would get scared). This movie goes way over the edge of reality, giving a little stupid kid one-million dollars (now who thinks that will ever happen just on accident?). It's another Disney thing where they go through and put a kid in an outlandish situation and make an unoriginal slapstick humor movie. In fact, when I told someone at the theater I work at that one new movie was directed by the guy who directed this one, he shuddered from remembering how horrible this movie really was.
__label__2 Johan's view: marriage is definitely more than a legal contract. This book explains that marriage is an illustration of God's covenant with his people. Marriage is not a place where you can come and go as you pleases, it is a lifelong commitment
__label__1 Truly Dreadful: I like Jonah Hill and I thought there would be a few laughs on this one, even though I know it was panned by critics First and foremost, this is not for kids. Any parent not sure, should watch the first 5 mins and you know what I mean. This movie has no laughs. Having young children read ridiculous dialogue that would never happen in real life makes it worse. Adam Sandler movies are very well known for this tactic. I dont want to discuss the plot, or lack of but you wont find Jonah mentioning this movie to anyone. This is not funny like Superbad or movies with some crude humor.
__label__1 Mr. Lucas' Opus Magnum: Mr. Lucas' Opus Magnum it isn't. The last 2 decades have produced a lot ofmediocre WW2 movies. But most of them were low budget indie movies. Thereforeone did not expect too much.Well, Mr. Lucas managed to achieve an even lower quality by wasting a lot ofmoney. The acting (and uttering of the atrocious dialogue) could be done betterby any reenactment group. The arial compact scenes might look impressive at firstbut are absolutely unrealistic.And the story line is the WW2 equivalent of a cheap Italian softporn movie.Cutboard characters (bad white officers, good black soldiers, evil Nazi Germans),implausible events (shortest captivity ever, Pilot taking multiple 30mm roundsbefore dying, P51 being nearly as fast as the ME262 etc.).So, don't waste you hard earned cash on this abominal mess of a film.If the Topic suits you, see the original HBO film or Buffalo Soldiers 44.Both not perfect but worlds ahead of this lousy waste of resources.
__label__2 Colour: These markers are good for general colouring and tinting, with the exception that the fine point does not hold up as well as I would like - it tends to blunt after a while.The pens seem to last a long time, not running out of colour and with the exception of the darkest green and blue pens - which were darker than the colour indicated on the pen all were true to their colour.
__label__1 Not willing to invest time and money with this: I finished the first bottle which went pretty quick with all they tell you to take. I am not sure what I was looking to find, I thought it would last longer to see better results. This would get real expensive to stick with it, and no way to tell if it is any better than just Saw Palmetto alone.
__label__2 Give this one a chance: First time I listened to this one, I was a little dissappointed that it wasn't "Come Find Yourself". After a few listens, I realized it's actually better in many ways. And believe it or not, the best songs are actually the ballads! Who would've thought that would be the case from the band that gave us "Scooby Snacks"?It takes a few listens to really get into this one, but when you do it's well worth it. This disc hasn't been out of my CD player for a couple of weeks now. It's a real gem.
__label__2 One of the few baby products I LOVE: What a great product. Very useful. I used it both in our kitchen sink and in the bathtub. Baby was always safe and secure and seemed to be comfortable. The bather folds up and hangs conveniently on the inside of the shower door. I HIGHLY recommend this product.
__label__2 Delightful language and illustrations: This book is a delight to read. It's fun to read the western dialect and phrases out loud, and to enjoy an especially creative adaptation of a familiar tale. The artwork is fun too. This is one of our favorites.
__label__2 Already submitted......A Century of Gay Poetry: This is not a review, I already submitted a review on the 30th of May, 2000 But I wanted to sumit a correction in the body of my review. I mentioned the poem "How to watch your brother die" and I attributed it to the wrong poet, the poet is Lassell, NOT Michaud. Thank you for letting me suggesting this correction in the body fo the review. And I understand that it best to let readers rate the number of stars in the rating system......forgoing contributors in this anthology, who may be biased. Thank you...for this opportunity to reach out in your space here at Amazon.com
__label__1 sorry it had no suspense. it just meandered.: this book accomplished things, but there was no tension. it seemed as if the author couldnt be serious the whole time the book was written. i really hope the next books are better, this is the first book ive read from irene. ive read a lot of books and i have no idea how this got more than one star
__label__1 BUYER BEWARE: The second ingredient is; Soduim Laureth Sulfate. This chemical is used in car, floor and other cleaning products. It is highly irritating to skin and studies show high levels of skin penetration in heart, liver, brain and lung tissue, eye damage on animals (even when applied to areas not around the eyes). It strips skin of protective lipids and irritates and drys it out. It can react with other ingredients and create nitrate substances which are known carcinogens. It has no good properties and does not belong in skin products.
__label__1 Not hot enough: This machine doesn't get hot enough to create truly crisp waffles. Using an infrared thermometer, I read the surface temperature to be only about 400 degrees Fahrenheit on the highest setting. My 20 year old Toastmaster reaches almost 600 degrees when I select "dark". These waffles come out much crisper and darker than those from the Cuisinart.
__label__2 Top-Notch Bluegrass Music!: You read the label and see that this group is comprised of members of the U.S. Navy Band. Well, don't be fooled by any pre-conceived notions - this is as good a bluegrass ensemble as you will ever hear. Lead singer Wayne Taylor has a great voice and a dynamic delivery that pulls you right into the songs. And the banjo player, Keith Arneson is a virtuouso picker with at least six fingers on his right hand! A fantastic group and a totally enjoyable experience - highly recommended.
__label__2 A Baby Page Turner! My son's favorite without question!: I got the book because the boy on the cover looks like my son. I bought it when he was four months old. He's one year next week. He's eaten the edges, bitten the cover, turned the pages, vomited on it (that was fun) pointed out the baby, pointed out the moon, thrown it, carried it, dragged it, patted it, yelled about it-all in the last nine months. I may have to get a new dazzler and one to replace this one but this is by far the best $3.00 I ever spent. (Ocean State Job Lot)
__label__2 excellent: The blade is sharp, and easy to replace. It saved me from having to buy a new clipper. I will buy these blades again.
__label__1 First Rate JUNK: We bought this product a year and a half ago and we have had nothing but trouble with it. Customer Service is useless.It's latest trick is to eat my DVD's and refuse to give them back!! Had to take the entire case off and open the door manually to retrieve my disk, which by the was is brand new and one I really wanted to watch.The machine is stuck on Welcome, welcome, welcome..and will go no further. Not sure it's even worth bothering to try to have someone fix it.I will NEVER again buy an RCA product. What has happened to this wonderful company? If you don't want tons of headaches..leave this piece of junk on the shelf!!!
__label__2 Look great! Good Value.: They look really nice and my wife loves them.She wanted something to wear while sleeping and at work (she's a nurse) that wasn't expensive and were comfortable. These fit the bill perfectly.Delivery was fast, too.
__label__1 Not The Greatest!!: I am personally dissapointed to admit to my friends that I actually purchased this cd. I am a big fan of DMX and the entire Ruff Ryder team but this cd is just flat out horrible. My only question is why is Jay-Z(Roc-A-Fella) on this compilation cd. That in my opinion is the worst part of this cd.
__label__1 Terrible!: There is about as much information in this 'book' as is on a badly researched Katie Holmes website. It has all of the obvious information that you probably already know. It is a mere 32 pages of large font and about 6 black and white photos. I could have written more and published a better book than this! Rather get "Katie Holmes Scene".
__label__2 Patricia Gray+: Savannah SmilesWe just love the video you sent. We expected a video tape, not a CD.My grand-daughter just loves this movie. Something happeded to the orignal we had. I thought of your company to relace it. We are all happy now!
__label__2 One of the best books of film criticism I've ever read: A paradigm of intelligent film criticism. Kolker's astute and subtle formal analysis of the films puts many other so-called critics to shame, and his discussions of the political implications of cinematic form and style are excellent. It is a serious book about movies, and his arguments and insights need to be thought about and struggled with- they are not a meant to be easily digested.
__label__2 Wonderful (Most accurate portrait shows positive and negative aspects of the man): Came away impressed, shows the favorable and unfavorable of the man equally well showing characteristics of biographers on the left (Roy Jenkins) and Right (Manchester)Worth seeing as so many portrayals don't give you a sense of the main characteristics of the man he is either entirely heroic or (rarely if at all entirely negative). But at the same time those seeking something either entirely favorable or entirely negative will be disappointed as the story seeks to be even.Mr Finney is exceptional and truly earns his Emmy other leads like Ms. Redgrave, Mr. Jacobi, are also quite good.
__label__2 a skepitc at first: I really didn't think I was going to like Avril's music, but once I heard the first few lines of Sk8ter Boi, I was hooked. It's a great CD with new look and attitude for girl rockers. Avril's voice is full of emotion and life. I amazed at her talents at such a young age.
__label__2 An album that must be experienced: A landmark work by the Magic Band. The music sounds like a desert with Beefheart's poetry the ghostly wind flying above. Listen to this if you have had enough of people telling you what improvisation is, or should be. I consider Trout Mask Replica as one of CB&TMB's three best works: _Trout Mask Replica_, _Safe As Milk_, and _Mirror Man_ (get the new Mirror Man Sessions if you can, as it is very successfully remastered and includes the excellent "Beetle Bones & Smokin' Stones.") The track "Ella Guru" is among my favorite Beefheart compositions, along with "Moody Liz" and "Autumn's Child."Get this album.
__label__1 intec fails to make its case!: geometrically impossible for this to hold even half of what they say it does. latch never functioned properly. not even worth the postage or the trouble to send it back to amazon. the cool aluminum parts will last 40-50000 years in the landfill i am going to put this in.
__label__1 Bad taste, extra ingredients: Remember what "organic"really means. It means that the ingredients were grown without pesticides, and is not a stamp of approval for all "good" or "natural" foods. It contains unnecessary ingredients. On top of that, it tastes really bad and my baby won't eat it.
__label__1 STAY CLEAR!!!!!: For whoever is reading this, PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VERSION! There is a version called "directors cut" (which is actually what was intended, Maple Pictures decided to cut out every scene that made the movie controversial to begin with). The edit of this particular film is actually quite ridiculous, because you could probably watch this version of the movie at a dinner party it's so heavily cut.Anyway, I know this should be a review, but this is not what Nick Palumbo intended so I cannot justifiably review it as such.
__label__1 bit set: product was shipped quickly and everything looked good untill I used the bits and found several were not true and couldnt be used. Some of the ones with a hole in center for security torx, the hole wasn't in the center so I couldn't use them either. I don't bother a company fussing with them, I'm the consumer that just don't go back to them again. I would not have written a review normally, but Amazon bugged me thru my e-mail to write a review, bottom line is that I do not think very much of the product.
__label__1 Never buy Cisco Linksys Router Again!: Linksys routers are a great product for the price. God forbid you ever have to call their tech support! I have been on the phone for almost 7 hours now (4 calls) and the router still doesn't work properly. I finally gave up and bought an Airport Extreme from Apple and (though more expensive) it was so easy to configure and is working perfectly! A tech support friend warned me that he has spent two hours on the phone with Linksys just to return one under warranty. No more Linksys for me!
__label__1 disappointing: This book was very disappointing, and unfortunately, not at all reliable with regard to this information provided. It is ashame, because such an introduction to Hebrew, intended for the lay person, was definitely needed. Back to waiting...
__label__2 A must read for every surfer.: This novel is a must read for every surfer who has taken a surf trip in search of their personal limits. It will remind you that you never know your limits until they are pushed, whether personal, emotional or physical. Kem Nunn expertly conveys the "feeling" of pushing your limits in search of them. During the summertime, when there is not a wave in the ocean, this book will get you stoked for the cold, hard winter surf.Ps. Please e-mail me if you have a copy of Tapping the Source you would like to sell or loan.
__label__2 Braun: Gotta have my coffee every morning and don't like to wait very long. If you don't use the auto timer so it's ready for you when you get up you can still get 10 cups of great coffee in about 7 minutes. It's not your $20 coffee maker though. I had one of those before I decided to step up to this Braun. The Gold filter and the Brita water filter combine to make one very smooth pot of coffee.
__label__2 Praise for Lokko's First Novel: After reading Ms. Lokko's second novel, "Saffron Skies", I had to read the first. "Sundowners" did not disappoint, with it's international flavor and celebration of women characters . Enjoy !!
__label__1 Ugh! Just Terrible!: What in the world was Nicholas Schaffner trying to accomplish? On every page he puts down either Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright or Nick Mason. Every album they put out, it seems, is a bore, and all of the songs on those albums are uninspired. He says through basically the whole book that none of the musicians are natural musicians, in fact, Shaffner almost seems resentful of Floyds succesfulness. A terrible book, stay away.
__label__2 Comfortable Back and Straps: The Lowepro Backpack is nondescript in appearance, probably on par with the standard black computer bag. Functionally it is great! There are multiple sections and pockets to hold everything a pack rat could want. Both the straps and back of the bag are covered in soft, padded, ventilated materials. I can barely tell that I am carrying around a large laptop.
__label__2 It's artsy: Perhaps overly complex. The story jumps out and grabs you. The writing is quirky, but the sentences are almost poetic. The story is great -- I sped through 420 pages, but the last 30 left me wanting a re-write. See if you can make it through the book without getting distracted by the presence of the word "angle" in every chapter, and the descriptions of the quality of light.I can't wait for his next one!
__label__1 Poor user's instructions: The product promises good results, but the instruction manual is very unfriendly and confusing -- and printed in such small fonts that one needs a magnifying glass to read it and a third hand to execute the steps that are indicated. Unfortunately, as an average customer, I have only two hands.After several attempts, I still have not been able to make the display light up permanently onto the ceiling.I look forward to resolving that, but the problem is that you need a combination of obscurity in the room to view the display on the ceiling, but light on the instruction manual to read it!
__label__2 excellent: This book is a must read for everyone everwhere. It is not just for business, but for life. A fun, entertaining read.
__label__1 Not viewable: This is the first time I am trying Unbox Video. It did not work. The Video Player kept crashing. I have a Pentium M Machine with 1 GB and running Windows XP Media Center Edition with SP2. Very dissapointing.
__label__2 Robin Williams Design Workshop: This book was very insightful. I am a desktop publishing professional and was looking for ideas for website design. This book enlightened me to the many considerations in designing for paper distribution versus web publishing. It asked questions on a number of design topics and based upon your expertise level, the author directed you to other references. The illustrations were great. I am going to purchase The Non-Designers Design Book and The Non-Designers Web Book by Robin Williams and John Tollett.
__label__1 Simply awful: Detuned guitars, horrible mix, diarrayed arrangements and no Guitar solos. This is not just a lousy Metallica album...it is a lousy album period. The direction seems to be Limp Bizkit meets Slayer with disasterous results. The days of Master of Puppets are long gone.....this is by far one of the worst cd's I have ever purchased.
__label__1 HORRIBLE!!!: This CD makes me angry. When I first heard that Metallica were going to get heavy again I was thrilled. Too bad they don't have a clue how to be heavy anymore. This album is a joke. Horrible production, horrible playing, horrible vocals and lyrics, and they even wasted a good cover artist. I would have rather them done another Load or Reload instead of this piece of crap. Everything about Metallica now is a joke. (Anybody ever see their new Metallica/SpongeBob Squarepants T-shirt they put out??)I urge everyone to NOT buy this album, and if you do already own it sell it or throw it out. Do not give Metallica anymore of your money and hopefully they'll go away soon. I find it funny that this is their least-selling album of their career.
__label__1 Please bring back the original!: This used to be one of my favorite party games. Then, someone had the not-so-brilliant idea of making it electronic. First of all, it didn't work. You could hit the bar multiple times and get no score at all. The loud buzzers and ticking was extremely annoying. If I can find an original version of this game, I will buy it, and I would recommend that original game to anyone, but this game? A piece of junk!
__label__2 Guitar God!: Axel Rudy Pell is perhaps the greatest unknown (in the US) metal guitarist today. He plays in the style of Ritchie Blackmore, but harder and faster. A reviewer said Axel "plays like he has only one day left to live", which is not an exaggeration. If you miss the melodic heavy metal of the 80's, or are a Blackmore/Rainbow fan, you owe it to yourself to listen to this disc!
__label__2 great gospel: I purchased this album on record many years ago, then on cassette tape, now on cd. I love Elvis singing gospel as much, if not more than, his other music. Some of the best gospel music you will hear.
__label__2 NEW REVIEW of a great $11 to $1(used) title.: This isn't selling well, hence the terrific price, but let me tell you that whether you spend ELEVEN,or ONE-dollar, you get your money's worth!Folks who only want the best restoration and bonus extras, might check out THE ULTIMATE STOOGE COLLECTION.The spoken language tracks areENGLISH/SPANISH, withENGLISH/SPANISH/FRENCH subtitles.All yooze foreign -- and domestic -- folks that speak somethingbesides ENGLISH might finally find out what "nyuck! nyuck! nyuck!" and "woo! woo! woo!"mean in Y=O=U=R country's language, eh?
__label__1 A naked boy covered in blood.: What is the most scary thing in the world? Well, according to the extra material on this DVD, in all cultures the most scary thing must be a naked teenage boy, covered in blood.A teenage boy, covered in blood. Walking. Sitting. Looking "scary". Accompanied by "scary" music. A weird script, going in different directions. And maybe I should write "scary 'music'". Because the "music" consists mostly of sound effects. Maybe that's symptomatic for this film. It's strange, and goes in different directions. At least the music and the script coincides in this manner...
__label__1 There was a screw missing: The standard arrived quickly. When I put it together to use, I discovered that one of the screws for locking the expandable legs was missing. An e-mail to the vendor resulted in no response. The legs can be made stable with duct tape (duct tape will fix anything) so the standard is useable, just not aesthetically pleasing.
__label__1 Totally predictable: Maybe I have just read too many thrillers, but I knew exactly what was going to happen long before it did. Toward the end I was yelling at the characters because it was taking them so long to figue things out. It was fast paced certainly but totally predictable.
__label__1 I did not like this book!: I really don't know why I finished this book. The charcters were as stupid as their names. Jane Eyre wasn't introduced until there was only 100 pages left. I hated the fact that they took classic books and 'changed' them. If "Jane Eyre" had such a [weak] ending, why was it considered such a classic?I don't know how to get across that I hated this book and only finished it to see how Eyre even fit in. The last 2 or 3 chapters were the worse. Next pretty much saves the world and gets what she wants. Imagine that! The entire time I was reading this book and couldn't help thinking a 12 year old must have written it. The language was as [bad] as the plot.Anyway- I guess it just wasn't my style. I hope this is never made into a movie as it would not make any sense on the screen.I will try not to let it out to anyone I know that I actually read this book.Now to read a real classic!
__label__1 DAY-LEWIS RULES !!!!!: THis guy proved once again who is the best in his game!! Man, more than five years aways from the screens and he comes back in such a memorable peformance, contending for the OSCAR, in a movie that portrays nothing more than a big-budgeted and old and banal history of revenge.It's a shame that himself has declared that he does not like movies,; he prefers theater much more. He's the best.
__label__2 The best discipline system. Period.: As a mental health professional for over 16 years, I've found 123 Magic to be the most powerful method of managing kids ages 2-12yrs. that I've ever come across. I've been recommending it to my clients for over 7 years and for many of them it really does work like magic. Down-to-earth, straight-forward, humorous and practical, 123 Magic is truly a godsend for kids and families. Dr. Phelan has made an extraordinary contribution to the field of children's mental health and to parents with 123 Magic. Whether you're a parent or a professional, 123 Magic is a must read!
__label__2 New design, same old water pik: Well, it only took them about 30+ years to change the design of the water pik, which until recently was the same as when I was a kid. The new one is much more aesthetic. Mechanically, it does what it is supposed to. The storage container on tip is neat too. Both of my dentists recommend it, and I trust them, so go out and get one.
__label__2 Common Sense: That's what Pavel teaches. Forget about the Pavelizer for a second (I'm sure Flabby Abbys can't do a Janda sit-up), the video shows exercises I never saw before, except for the wheel. The Saxon Side Bend? Full Contact Twists? Awesome movements painful in their simplicity. I've stopped doing crunches and have begun doing Dragon Flags, what a movement. Well worth the [money]. And the Ab Pavelizer? Don't need it if you have a partner. But, since I don't, I have one, and I'm glad I do. My abs are harder, tighter than ever. No mistakes, Pavel is the man!
__label__1 Rushed and a disappointment: Usually, Peter David's books in the New Frontier series are funny, entertaining and a pleasure to read. However, this storyline seems rushed. In previous books, Janos is introduced as a Mugato. Now, we are expected to forget anything we have read about Janos as a new background is written about him that seems, even in the Star Trek realm, hard to digest. I won't give away the details, but, this book is a disappointment, unusual considering the breadth of David's writing.
__label__1 Terrible: I mean i got it to work somehow but definitely NOT satisfied. it is not Windows digitally signed so it gives you problems. For example when the device is plugged i can't use my usb keyboard. i have to unplug it (not only shut off, it has to be physically disconnected)...i emailed the tech support about it and unless they solve the problem by tomorrow, i am returning it and getting a windows compatible one. i mean it works with windows (i have XP pro SP2) but not good... spent the entire day with this problems...pay $15 more and get a good one!!! i hope tech support will solve it but i doubt it cuz i think if they could they would have done it already...
__label__1 Disappointed.: For starters, I did not receive this book on time. While waiting an addition 2 weeks for the book, I was faced with the unfortunate task of paying full price for a new book in the student book store on campus. When I contacted the seller and told them that I had sent it back with the intent of getting a refund, they claimed to have never received the book and therefore denied me the money. This was the worst experience with an Amazon seller I have ever had.
__label__1 B-complete: Just switched to this brand. Not crazy about it. I don't feel any difference in regard to feeling calmer or more relaxed. I'll switch next time I have to order.
__label__2 Makes Life Easier!: How convenient to be able to toggle between functions! What range! Having the ability to control mouse functions from a distance allows me, as a presenter, to move about the room more freely. It's truly a fantastic product, but there are two things I think could be improved. First, the size of the built-in laser pointer beam could be larger and/or slightly more intense. Unless I give a presentation in the dark, the pointer is useless. Secondly, the response time of the transmitter (remote) following a delay needs an adjustment. I don't know if this is due to plug-and-play issues between the USB receiver and the operating system (XP Professional), but it's the one thing that kept me from awarding this product a five star rating.
__label__2 Excellent resource for sellers: This is a fantastic resource who want to sell products using PayPal. O'Reilly has had an excellent run with the Hacks series and this is no exception. The book contains one hundred relevant recipes for common problems facing PayPal sellers (and to some extent buyers using PayPal.) Examples include fraud protection, hacking forms, customizing forms and pages, and setting up notifications.I recommend this book for anyone who is serious about selling products over PayPal.
__label__2 re: great replacement surface: easy to put on, great surface, just enough pop and great for spin. very energetic. cuts clean and easy. nice
__label__1 Far Too Basic for a Book: Get ready, here is the book's "secret": pay your bills and save more money.Yes, that's it. It is sad that financial journalists can get away with publishing such pithy, obvious advice. If you really are interested in practical ideas to conquer debt and change your life, read Dave Ramsey. This book is far too simple to justify purchasing it. Get it from the library.
__label__2 Logitech Keyboard: For around $30, I think it is pretty hard to find a nicer keyboard and mouse. Sure, there are nicer ones out there, but it is hard to beat in terms of quality for the price.
__label__2 I wore a cross necklace to bed for a year after reading this book.: Granted, I was only 13 when this book came out, but my friend and I were both so totally freaked out by this book that we both wore crosses 24/7 for a year. I have never read this book since (I plan to one day), but this was one of the creepiest things I have ever read, and to this day I remember scenes from the book that make me shiver. A total classic horror book in my estimation.
__label__2 Sleep, sleep , sleep: I purchased this CD for myself for relaxation purposes. I am so delighted with it that I have purchased several for gifts.I have never really heard the entire CD because I always fall asleep, but it is most enjoyable and helpful for relaxing and healing.
__label__1 Did not live up to expectations...: This is a pretty fireplace screen, don't get me wrong, but it is cheaply made. I should have gone with my gut feeling after reading previous reviews. It is not worth the money I paid for it. It's very light weight and easily bends. We had bought one at Target that was much better quality and better weight for less that we were replacing for this one only because it was taller. I would suggest you keep looking if you don't want to be disappointment.
__label__1 Too Much English. Not enough Italian: This DVD is heavy on the English and short on the Italian. It spends way too much time on the word "ciao" and cute skits(mostly in English) on its pronunciation. Meanwhile, it givesyou a very complicated set of rules (again primarily in English) for the pronunciation of vowels and consonant combinations which it whips through in blinding speed and are probably only appropriate for persons wishing to major in Italian as a career. Its very short on vocabulary building and you will learn only a very few words of Italian and Italian phrases. Its filled with fluff and skits which try to be cute (and usually fail) and are mostly in English. I really cannot recommend this DVD to anyone. You won't learn much Italian words and phrases from it.
__label__2 Will I Ever Get Enough??: As always, I love all things AB FAB. I am so happy the gang has returned after many year's absence, without missing a beat. The chemistry is still strong between all the players. It's like going to a dear and slightly "mental" friend's house - never a dull moment. So I guess the answer to my rhetorical question is: Certainly Not Yet.
__label__2 Inflation You Want: A quick, painless way to inflate my duraball pro. The valve assortment is also attached to the pump, making it almost impossible to lose them.
__label__1 Great Concert, lousy DVD: How could a man of Paul McCartney's stature allow this to happen? The sound and video quality of this DVD are on par with old VHS -- video full of noise and color bleed, sound is flat and strident. I was at the Philly concert and can honestly call it one of the top 3 concert experiences of my life. Paul was mesmerizing. That's what made it so painful to see the concert reduced to B movie quality on this DVD. Paul, please watch Bruce Springsteen's "Live in NYC" DVD to see how beautifully a concert DVD can be done. Also see Talking Heads' "Stop Making Sense" and "The Who -- Live at the Royal Albert Hall." These are examples of great video, audio, and editing. Paul deserved better treatment. The rapid cuts and being pulled out of the concert between every song for behind the scenes really defeated any sense of "being there." I can recommend the DVD on the merits of the performance alone. But be forwarned, it ain't pretty.
__label__2 One of Lang's best collections: While I love all of Andrew Lang's collections, I think this has to be one of my favorites. This is a collection that pretty much goes out of its way to collect every strange, exotic, and unknown tale on the face of the planet. Far from the simplicity of other tales, these are complex and detailed. Which probably means they were not passed down quite as much, but are wondrous and inspiring just the same
__label__1 NO Red Lettering!: I specifically purchased this Bible because the "Look Inside" pages had red lettering. But when it arrived, I was very disappointed to find absolutely no red lettering. I purchase almost everything through Amazon, and 99% of the time I'm delighted, but unfortunately, this was a dud. Amazon, please change the "Look Inside" to accurately reflect what's really in the book.
__label__2 Running with Poco: Poco's Running Horse Compact Disc provides eleven terrific and new songs from veterans Rusty Young, Paul Cotton, and new comer Jack Sundrud. This is a must buy for everyone who enjoys the California Country Pop/Rock Sound of the 60's & 70's.This is Poco's finest effort to date. Poco continues to craft excellent songs, provide solid song arrangements with strong vocals, and use of Rusty's magic steel guitar. Each song is timeless. My favorite tracks are Rusty's "One Tear at a Time" and "Forever"; Paul's "I Can Only Imagine" and "Everytime I Hear that Train"; and Jack's "Never Loved" and "Shake It."So if you are sitting on a fence don't burn a few songs invest in Running Horse it won't let you down. Also pick up Paul Cotton's Firebird CD it's a great buy.
__label__2 THE FUNNIES THING IN THE WORLD!: I read the book, My Life an a Blundering Balernina. If you didn't, then please do. It's so funny!
__label__2 I GOT ALL 4 CDS FROM SKULL: This is a good cd from skull - he put out a 2nd cd on NO LIMIT in 1998 which was very good - he left in 1999 and has since put out 2 more cds which are worth getting.IF YOU LIKE OLD NO LIMIT 1990 - 1996CHECK OUT KANE AND ABEL, MIA X AND DANGEROUS DAME.
__label__2 pads: These work great for bladder protection. They are light weight & comfortable to wear daily. Price is good also for the product.
__label__1 WARNING! Lazy author.: If you like a story that is unfinished, then this may be the series for you. Read user comments on the last book of this series. The author has lost interest in this story. If you don't mind unfinished stories with seemingly obscure plot direction, so many characters that you have scratch your head and say "Who is this guy again?", this series is for you.The author lost control of his story line and now can't come up with decent way to tie it all together for the reader. The signs were there in the time it took the author to come up with the next book.It becomes a rambling, directionless mess toward the end.Avoid it and the author, it will only frustrate most readers.
__label__1 Buy for looks rather than substance....: The turntable plays 33 1/3 12-15% faster than it should on my model. The speakers are also throughly mediocre sounding for such a large system. All and all, a rather dissatisfying performance.
__label__1 Nightmare installation: Don't buy this modem if you have Windows 2000. Even though the box claims that the modem can be installed on Windows 2000, the drivers CD accompanying the modem has no drivers for Windows 2000! AFter discovering that, I went to their website and downloaded the driver for 2000. But 2000 would not install the driver because it kept complaining about missing INF files. I find it hard to believe that this product was released without testing drivers for Windows 2000.
__label__1 A Very, Very Disappointing Book!!: I'll admit, when I first read this book, I was so happy about the ending, I almost cried. I was so happy for Scarlett. This was in part because I cried for a full hour after finishing GWTW. I was heartbroken. Then I reread Scarlett. The plot was alright, but it was so impractical, I could hardly believe it! The Scarlett I knew from GWTW was not the Scarlett in the sequel. The style of writing can't compare, and neither can the plot. Scarlett was determined in this book, but she never would have done those things, like giving up Tara. I am sorry I read it.
__label__2 Looks cheap.... but is very sharp and highly effective: As other reviews have noted, this knife looks and feels very light and almost too thin, but is highlyl effective in many small tool applications and is very sharp and easy to clean and store. Great new addition and follow-up to other Victorinox purchases.
__label__1 utter and complete drivel: The automatic rating system forces me to give this awful film a rating of one star when, in truth, it deserves a minus five..... ....Shot with what would appear to be cheap hand-helds and suffering from some of the worst lighting imaginable and not aided in any way by make-up,hair,wardrobe or art direction,it is proof positive that film cameras should never be given to amateurs.The only person in the entire film who can actually act is amusingly enough the "straight character" Otherwise to a man there is not a professional actor in the bunch.Their only instruction from the director seems to have been not to look directly into the camera.There is not a single arresting or even engaging moment in this thin and superficial story of one man's inability to discover who it is that he is actually in love with.The problems with the trite and angst driven script are further mitigated by the odd editing which left us thinking at one point that our DVD player was malfunctioning.
__label__2 Fun, even for the little guys...: This item has been a hit with my son. He is only 3 1/2, but can make the gun work. He has enjoyed seeing how fast his hot wheel cars are going, but also has been checking out how fast many other things go also, especially his older sister. She, age 5, has even enjoyed this toy. I bought this for my son because it had caught his eye from ads somewhere. I was worried that it would be too advanced for him, but he has been able to enjoy it. A must for boys of all ages!
__label__2 Wild Swans: You talk about being amazed. How could I have been on this earth and known so little about what Mao and his comrads were doing to the people of China? It's hard to believe that this could have happened and that Mao was really loved and praised by so many who almost thought of him as their Savior. This book is amazing. I'm glad I stumbled upon it. Great read!
__label__1 Rent Theatrical, but wait for Extended to Buy: Of course I won't deny myself watching Lord of the Rings Theatrical version on Blu-ray as soon as it is released. However, I will be renting it, not owning it. I'll wait for the extended version before buying my own copy. Might even wait for the 3rd blu-ray release when they eventually combine Theatrical and Extended options in one set (which they should have offered on this first release).
__label__2 EC 301 Intermediate Micro: Easy to read, at least more so than accounting. If you can afford it, buy it.
__label__2 90 Minutes in Heaven: My dad recommended the book and since I started reading it we have had some great discussions. It has been an encouraging book to read.
__label__1 Large print edition too hard to handle.: My grandmother is an avid UpWords player. At 98, her eyesight isn't what it once was, and she needs to use a magnifying glass to use her small print version of this dictionary. So I thought it would be a great idea to get her this large print edition. I had read reviews, but didn't see any on this particular version. When it arrived I felt like kicking myself for not considering the size. It's about 8x11, and weighs just about five pounds. Basically it's got the heft of a bag of sugar, but it's twice as unwieldy, being large and floppy. No way on earth my grandmother could handle this.I guess this edition would be good for someone in great physical condition with the exception of poor vision.
__label__1 As bad as the titles sound: These guys try to make fun of the new wave scene with a lame B-52's imitation and a bunch of barely-funny dirty jokes. Probably done by a bunch of old-school rock musicians that just "didn't get" the new wave movement, or were just trying to sell this stuff on shock value. Unfortunately, it backfired on them. This was their only album.
__label__2 Cuisinart SM-55BK 5-1/2-Quart 12-Speed Stand Mixer: I bought this mixer for my wife and although shes only used it three times she loves it.(two cakes and frosting).She says its easy to use and clean. Both the manual and the DVD where helpful.She loves the timer, now she can get the next part of the recipe going instead of standing there watching the clock.The splash guard is great it keeps stuff in the bowl where it belongs and since its attached to the mixing head it flips up when you need to remove the bowl.
__label__2 Hmmm...: Im not entirely sure what to think of these guys. the first time i heard these guys was on the radio. i said to myself "what the hell..." and prepared myself to change the station, but something stopped me. I listened in a little more and couldnt help but be intrigued. I am a big fan of street punk, and you can definately hear its impression on this band. They sound like a 70s punk rock/ hip hop/ hardcore band. They actually seem to have some good talent which so many new bands lack anymore. They do seem slightly generic to me but something sets them apart from the cookie cutter pop emo crap you find all over the place anymore. I still do take a good liking to them though, very catchy. I suggest anyone who is into almost any kind of music go out and purchase this cd, you wont be let down.
__label__1 Didn't work at all.: I kept breaking out! I wouldn't recommend this. Try the cleansing pads from Say Yes To Tomatoes. They actually work!
__label__1 Is this spirituality?: The idea that there are really angels out there, and one is assigned to take care of us, is an extremely childish idea. All you have to do is look at the devastation around you, the pain and the needless suffering to convince you that it is not so.One can ask angels anything, we find out in this booklet, from a house to a car, a girlfriend or even a parking spot on a busy day.This is not materialism, the authors inform us, it is self-empowerment. With this nonsense, modern American spirituality has touched rock bottom. I just hope this is a fad that passes through quickly. Certainly the angel of the two authors has delivered big! With their terminal cheerfulness they have touched the life of many innocent American souls and vastly expanded their bank account.
__label__2 sanuks, order a size smaller: My daughter loves these shoes. To an adult, they appear more like an unlined slipper. Based on her sisters advice, we ordered a size smaller, aat first they appeared like they would be way to small.....but.....they stretch quickly and fit fine now.
__label__2 jungle candles: Candles are small and only printed on one side, but my son really liked them on his jungle birthday cake!
__label__1 Worst Math book I've ever owned.: This math book cannot stand on it's own to convey the knowledge of Calculus. Although there are not many errors, there are errors, which is inexcusable for an 8th try (edition). It's not as if Calculus changes. However, that's not my primary complaint. The problem with the book is that it does a poor job of teaching. It takes some of the simplest ideas, and seems to make an effort to complicate them - as if they're trying to make Calculus harder than it is. Also, it sometimes takes space to explain easy topics while glossing over more difficult ones. I have found Calculus relatively easy to understand, but no thanks to this book. I can't imagine how people who don't find math easy must feel trying to trudge through this book.
__label__2 This book was awesome!: I love to read and I love to read books that I can't put down. This was one of those. The book started out interesting and continued on from there. The trial transcripts at the first of each chapter were a departure from the normal telling of a story, but very effective. The twist at the end -- I never saw it coming. I can't wait for this new author's next book.
__label__2 Inspiring/Lyrical cd: Kj-52 Is a great lyricst. How he can talk about the lord and also flip it with dope lyrics is tight. This cd is a must buy the tracks are hot everything is good about this cd. If you want a lyrical/ inspiring cd that hes meaning to it this is it. Kj-52 mad props your mad dope keep doing your thing and inspiring people about christ and also laying it down with tight rhymes.
