The Problem Statement
```
The idea behind the sentiment analysis to find positive, negative or neutral comments or reviews from the e-commerce 
platform comes from rude and vulgar words or comments used during writing reviews. Although the issue may seem small and insignificant,
however, there are multiple views that support how hateful speeches and comments could affect a vendorâ€™s shop rating status. 
Moreover, negative and rude comments can affect other buyers' perception of the product that is reviewed. 
Thus, the economic well-being of the shop would decrease unnecessarily. Therefore, this project aims to identify positive, negative, and neutral comments,
alongside to filter the number of negative comments to help reduce prejudice of a product.
